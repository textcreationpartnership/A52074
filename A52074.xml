            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MR. <hi>Walter Marſhal,</hi> Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of theſe Directions how to attain to that practice and manner of Life which we call Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, or Godlineſs, was Educated in <hi>New Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and was a Fellow of the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and afterwards he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a <hi>Fellow of the Colledge at Wincheſter,</hi> but was put under the <hi>Bartholomew
<pb facs="tcp:96243:3"/>Buſhel,</hi> with nigh two Thouſand more Lights, (<hi>a Sin not yet repented of</hi>) whoſe illuminations made the Land a <hi>Goſhen.</hi> He was eſteemed a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,</hi> and was called to be Paſtor to a People at <hi>Goſpert</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> where he ſhined though he had not the Publick Oile; the ſubſtance of theſe Meditations were there Spun out of his own Experiences, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been much exerciſed with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Thoughts, and that for many Years, and had by many Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Methods ſought Peace of Conſcience; but notwithſtanding all, his Troubles ſtill increaſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he conſulted others, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> (whoſe Writings he had been much converſant with,) who thereupon told Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> he took them too Legally: He afterwards conſulted an Eminent Divine, (giving him an Account of the State of
<pb facs="tcp:96243:3"/>his Soul, and particularizing his Sins that lay heavy on his Conſcience;) who in his Reply told him, He had forgot to mention the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sin of all, the Sin of Unbelief, in not believing on the Lord Jeſus for the Remiſſion of his Sins, and Sanctifying his Nature. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſet himſelf to the ſtudying and preaching of Chriſt, and attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eminent Holineſs, great peace of Conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi>'s dying Words were theſe, <hi>The wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> having but juſt before ſaid to thoſe about him, that he now dyed in the full perſwaſion of the Truth, and in the comfort of that Doctrine which he had Preached; the ſum where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is contained in the enſuing Diſcourſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:96243:4"/>
            <p>Some time ſince he was tranſlated by Death, <hi>Elijah</hi>-like, dropping theſe ſheets, as his Mantle, for ſucceeding <hi>Eliſha's</hi> to go forth with for the Converſion of Sinners, and Comfort of drooping Souls.</p>
            <p>Theſe Papers are the profound Experiences of a ſtudious Holy Soul, Learned of the Father, coming from his very Heart, and ſmell of no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Deſign but for Holineſs and Happineſs; yet it is to be feared they will ſcarcely go down with the heady Notionaliſts of this Age, who are of the Tribe of <hi>Reuben,</hi> waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with every Wind of Modiſh Doctrine, but in <hi>Judah</hi> it will be praiſed, and we may hope that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Shrubs and Cedars hereby may advance in knowledge and comfort. But not to detain thee longer, read over all theſe Directions (that you may fully underſtand the Author) or
<pb facs="tcp:96243:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>read none; if you do it with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humble ſpirit in which they were wrote, it may be hop'd (the matter being ſo weighty, and from ſo able an Hand) through the Grace of God they will ſink into thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and make thee a ſolid Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, full of Faith, Holineſs and Conſolation.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That we may acceptably perform the Duties of Holineſs and Righteonſneſs required in the Law, our first Work is to learn the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual Means whereby we may attain to ſo Great an End.</hi>

               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>THIS Direction may ſerve inſtead of a Preface, to prepare the Underſtanding and Attention of the Reader for thoſe that follow: And <hi>First,</hi> It acquainteth you with the Great End for which all thoſe Means are deſigned, that are the principal Subject to be here treated of: the Scope of all is, To teach you how you may attain to that Practice and Manner of Life, which we call Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, or Godlineſs, Obedience, True Religion; and which God requireth of us in the Law, particularly in the Moral Law,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.</note> ſummed up in the Ten Commandments, and more briefly in thoſe Two great Commandments, of Love to God and our Neighbour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.37, 39. and more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained throughout the Holy Scriptures. My work is to ſhew how the Duties of this Law may be done, when they are known: therefore, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect not that I ſhould delay my intent to help you to the knowledge of them, by any large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96243:6"/>of them; which is a Work already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in ſeveral Catechiſms and Commentaries: yet, that you may not miſs the Mark for want of diſcerning of it, take notice, in few words, that the Holineſs which I would bring you to, is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. It conſiſts not only in external Works of Piety and Charity, but in the Holy Thoughts, Imaginations, and Affections of the Soul, and chiefly in Love, from whence all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good Works muſt flow, or elſe they are not acceptable to God: not only in refraining the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ſinful Luſts, but in luſting and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do the Will of God, and in a chearful O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God, without repining, fretting, grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any Duty, as if it were a grievous Yoak and Burthen to you.</p>
               <p>Take Notice further, That the Law, which is your Mark, is exceeding broad, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.96. and yet not the more eaſie to be hit, becauſe you muſt aim to hit it in every Duty of it, with a perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of equal breadth, or elſe you cannot hit it all, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.10. The Lord is not at all loved with that Love that is due to him as Lord of all, if he be not loved with all our Heart, Spirit, and Might. We are to love every thing in him, his Juſtice, Holineſs, Sovereign Authority, All-ſeeing Eye, and all his Decrees, Commands, Judgments, and all his Doings. We are to love him not only bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than other things, but ſingly, as Only Good, the Fountain of all Goodneſs; and to reject all fleſhly and worldly Enjoyments, even our own Lives, as if we hated them, when they ſtand in competition with our Enjoyment of him, or our Duty toward him. We muſt love him as to yield ourſelves wholly up to his conſtant Service in all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96243:6"/>things, and to his diſpoſal of us as our abſolute Lord, whether it be for Proſperity or Adverſity, Life or Death: and for his ſake we are to love our Neighbour, even all Men, whether they be Friends or Foes to us, and ſo do to them in all things that concern their Honour, Life, Chaſtity, Worldly Wealth, Credit, and Content, whatever we would that Men ſhould do to us in the like Condition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. This Spiritual Univerſal Obedience is the Great End, to the attainment whereof I am directing you. And that you may not reject mine Enterprize as impoſſible, obſerve that the moſt I promiſe, is no more than an acceptable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of theſe Duties of the Law, ſuch as our gracious merciful God will certainly delight in, and be pleas'd with, during our State of Imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this World, and ſuch as will end in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Holineſs, and all Happineſs in the World to come.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed further, ſtay your thoughts a while, in the contemplation of the great Dignity and Excellency of theſe Duties of the Law, that you may aim at the performance of them as your End, with ſo high an eſteem as may caſt an amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble luſter upon the enſuing diſcovery of the Means. The principal Duties of Love to God above all, and to each other for his ſake, from whence all the other Duties flow, are ſo excellent, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine any more Noble Work for the Holy Angels in their glorious Sphere: They are the chief Works for which we were at firſt framed by the Image of God, engraven upon Man in the firſt Creation, and for which that beautiful Image is renewed upon us in our New Creation and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall be perfected
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96243:7"/>in our Glorification. They are Works which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not meerly on the Sovereignty of the Will of God, to be commanded or forbidden, or left indifferent, or changed, or aboliſhed at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as other Works that belong either to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial or Ceremonial Law, or to the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation preſcribed by the Goſpel; but they are in their own Nature holy, juſt, and good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12. and meet for us to perform, becauſe of our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral relation to our Creator and Fellow-Creatures; ſo that they have an inſeparable dependance upon the Holineſs of the Will of God, and an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Eſtabliſhment thereby. They are Works ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to render the Performers holy in all manner of Converſation, by the Fruits which they bring forth, if no other Duties had ever been commanded, and by which the performance of all other Duties is ſufficiently eſtabliſhed as ſoon as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and without which there can be no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Heart and Life imagined, and to which it was one great Honour of Moſaical, and is now of Evangelical Ordinances, to be ſubſervient, for the performance of them as Means which ſhall ceaſe, when their End, this never-failing Charity is perfectly attained, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. They are Duties which we were naturally obliged to, by that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding which God gave to Man at his firſt Creation, to diſcern what was juſt and meet for him to do, and to which even Heathens are ſtill obliged by the Light of Nature, without any written Law, or ſupernatural Revelation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14.15. Therefore they are called Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Law that requireth them is called the Natural Law, and alſo the Moral Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Manners of all Men, Infidels as well as
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96243:7"/>Chriſtians, ought to be conformed to it (and if they had been fully conformable, they would not have come ſhort of Eternal Happineſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 10, 27, 28.) under the penalty of the Wrath of God for the violation of it. This is the true Morality which God approveth of, conſiſting in conformity of all our Actions to the Moral Law; and if thoſe that in theſe days contend ſo highly for Morality, do underſtand no other than this, I dare joyn with them in aſſerting, <note place="margin">The greatest Saint is the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist.</note> that the beſt morally honeſt Man is the greateſt Saint, and that Morality is the principal part of true Religion, and the Teſt of all other parts, without which Faith is dead, and all other Religious Performances are a vain ſhew, and meer hypocriſie; for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true Witneſs hath teſtified concerning the two great Moral Commandments of Love to God, and our Neighbour, that there is none other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment greater than theſe, and that on them hang all the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.31. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.40.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing contained in this Introductory Direction, is the neceſſity of learning the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual Means, whereby this great and excellent End may be accompliſhed, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this the firſt Work to be done, before we can expect ſucceſs in any attempt for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
               <p>This is an Advertiſement very needful, becauſe many are apt to skip over the Leſſon concerning the Means (that will fill up this whole Treatiſe) as ſuperfluous and uſeleſs. When once they know the Nature and Excellency of the Duties of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96243:8"/>Law, they account nothing wanting but diligent performances; and they ruſh blindly upon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Practice, making more haſt than good ſpeed. They are quick in promiſing, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.8. All that the Lord hath ſpoken we will do, without ſitting down, and counting the coſt. They look upon Holineſs as only the Means of an End, Eternal Salvation, not as an End itſelf, requiring any great means to the attaining to the Practice of it. The enquiry of moſt, when they begin to have a ſence of Religion, is, What good thing ſhall I do that I may have Eternal Life? (<hi>Mat.</hi> 19.16.) Not, How ſhall I be enabled to do any thing that is good? Yea, many that are accounted power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preachers, ſpend all their Zeal in the earneſt preſſing the immediate Practice of the Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſcovery of the effectual means of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; as if the Work of Righteouſneſs were like thoſe ſervile Employments, that need no skill and artifice at all, but induſtry and activity. That you may not ſtumble at the Threſhold of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Life by this common overſight, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make you ſenſible, that it is not enough for you to know the matter and reaſon of your Duty, but that you are alſo to learn the powerful and effectual means of performance, before you can ſucceſsfully apply yourſelves to immediate Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. And for this end I ſhall lay before you the Conſiderations following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We are all by Nature void of all ſtrength and ability to perform acceptably that Holineſs and Righteouſneſs which the Law requireth, and are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, and Children of Wrath, by the Sin of our firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> as the Scripture witneſſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 15, 18, 19.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96243:8"/>
                  <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8. This Doctrine of Original Sin, which Proteſtants generally profeſs, is a firm Baſis and Ground-work to the aſſertion now to be proved, and to many other aſſertions in this whole Diſcourſe. If we believe it to be true, we cannot rationally encourage ourſelves to attempt an holy Practice, until we are acquainted with ſome powerful and effectual means to enable us for it. While Man continued upright in the Image of God, as he was at firſt created, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. he could do the Will of God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely as ſoon as he knew it; but when he was fallen, he was quickly afraid, becauſe of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, but could not help it at all, until God diſcovered to him the means of reſtoration, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.10. Say to a ſtrong healthy Servant, Go, and he goeth; Come, and he cometh; Do this, and he doth it; but a bedridden Servant muſt know firſt how he may be enabled. No doubt the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels know the neceſſity of Holineſs, and tremble at the guilt of their Sin; but they know of no means for them to attain to Holineſs effectually, and ſo continue ſtill in their wickedneſs. It was in vain for <hi>Sampſon</hi> to ſay, <hi>I will go out as at other times before, and ſhake myſelf,</hi> when he had ſinned away his ſtrength, <hi>Judges</hi> 16.20. Men ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtrangely forgetful, or hypocritical in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Original Sin, in their Prayers, Catechiſms, and Confeſſions of Faith, and not urging upon themſelves and others, the Practice of the Law, without the conſideration of any ſtrengthning, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening Means, as if there were no want of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but only of activity.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96243:9"/>
               <p n="2">2ly, Thoſe that doubt of, or deny the Doctrine of Original Sin, may all of them know concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, (if their Conſciences be not blind) that the exact Juſtice of God is againſt them, and they are under the Curſe of God, and Sentence of Death for their actual ſins, if God ſhould enter into Judgment with them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. &amp; 2.2. &amp; 3.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Is it poſſible for a Man that knoweth this to be his Caſe, and hath not learned any means of getting out of it, to practiſe the Law immediately? To love God and every thing in him, his Juſtice, Holineſs, Power, as well as his Mercy, and to yield himſelf willingly to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of God, though God ſhould inflict ſudden Death upon him? Is there no skill or artifice at all required in this Caſe, to encourage the fainting Soul to the Practice of Univerſal Obedience?</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, Tho' Heathens might know much of the Work of the Law by the common Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon and Underſtanding, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. yet the effectual Means of performance cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by that Light, and therefore are wholly to be learned by the teaching of ſupernatural Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. For what is our Natural Light, but ſome ſparks and glimmerings of that which was in <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall? And even then in its brighteſt Meridian, it was not ſufficient to direct <hi>Adam</hi> how to recover ability to walk holily, if once he ſhould loſe it by ſin; nor to aſſure him before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand that God would vouchſafe to him any means of recovery: God had ſet nothing but Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes in caſe of Tranſgreſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. and therefore he hid himſelf from God, when the ſhame of his Nakedneſs appeared, as expecting no favour from him. We are like Sheep gone aſtray,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96243:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>and know not which way to return, until we hear the Shepherd's Voice, Can theſe dry Bones live to God in holineſs? O Lord thou knoweſt, and we cannot know it, except we learn it of thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly, Sanctification, whereby our Hearts and Lives are conformed to the Law, is a Grace of God communicated to us by means, as well as Juſtification, and by means of teaching and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething that we cannot ſee without the Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.17, 18. There are ſeveral things pertaining to Life and Godlineſs, that are given through knowledge, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. There is a form of Doctrine made uſe of by God to make People free from Sin, and Servants of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. And there are ſeveral Pieces of the whole Armour of God neceſſary to be known, and put on, that we may ſtand againſt Sin and Satan in the evil day, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.13. Shall we ſlight and overlook the way of Sanctification, when the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the way of Juſtification hath been counted worth ſo many elaborate Treatiſes.</p>
               <p n="5">5ly, God hath given in the Holy Scriptures by his inſpiration, plentiful inſtruction in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>that we may be throughly furniſhed for every good work,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16, 17. eſpecially <hi>ſince the day ſpring from an high hath viſited us, by the appearance of the Lord Jeſus Christ, to guide our feet in the way of peace, Luke</hi> 1.78, 79. If God condeſcend to us very low, to teach us this way in the Scriptures, and by Chriſt himſelf, it muſt needs be greatly neceſſary for us to ſit down at his feet and learn it.</p>
               <p n="6">6ly, The way of attaining to Godlineſs is ſo far from being known without learning out of the Holy Scripture, that when it is here plainly revealed, we
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96243:10"/>cannot learn it ſo eaſily as the Duties of the Law, which are known in part by the Light of Nature, and therefore more eaſily aſſented unto. It is the way whereby the Dead are brought to live unto God, and therefore doubtleſs it is far above all the thoughts and conjectures of human Wiſdom. It is the way of Salvation, wherein God will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtanding of the prudent, by diſcovering things by his Spirit, that the natural Man receiveth not; for they are fooliſhneſs to him, neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19.21. &amp; 2.14. Without controverſie, <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. The learning of it requireth double work; becauſe we muſt unlearn many of our former deeply rooted Notions, and become fools that we may be wiſe. We muſt pray earneſtly to the Lord, to teach us, as well as ſearch the Scriptures, that we may get this knowledge. <hi>O that my ways were directed to keep thy ſtatutes. Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy ſtatutes, and I ſhall keep it to the end,</hi> Pſal. 119.5.33. <hi>Teach me to do thy will,</hi> Pſal. 14.3, 10. <hi>The Lord direct your hearts unto the love of God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.5. Surely theſe Saints did not ſo much want teaching and direction concerning the Duties of the Law to be done, as concerning the Way and Means whereby they might do them.</p>
               <p n="7">7ly, The certain knowledge of theſe powerful and effectual Means, is of greateſt importance and neceſſity for our eſtabliſhment in the true Faith, and avoiding Errors contrary thereunto: For we cannot rationally doubt, that the Moral Duties of Love to God and our Neighbour are abſolutely neceſſary to true Religion, ſo that it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96243:10"/>cannot ſubſiſt without them. And from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple we may firmly conclude, that nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the practice of theſe holy Duties ought to be received as a Point of Faith delivered to us by the moſt holy God; and that whatſoever is truly neceſſary, powerful, and effectual to bring us to the practice of them, ought to be believed as proceeding from God, becauſe it hath the Image of his Holineſs and Righteouſneſs engraven upon it. This is a ſure Teſt and Touch-ſtone, which thoſe that are ſeriouſly Religious will uſe to try Spirits and their Doctrines, whether they be of God or no: And they cannot rationally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove any Doctrine as Religious, that is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. By this Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone Chriſt proveth his Doctrine to be of God, becauſe therein he ſeeketh the Glory of God, <hi>John</hi> 7.17, 18. And he teacheth us to know falſe Prophets by their fruits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. wherein the fruits which their Doctrine tendeth unto, are eſpecially to be conſidered. Hence it appeareth, that until we know what are the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Means of Holineſs, and what not, we want a neceſſary Touch-ſtone of Divine Truth, and may be eaſily deceived by falſe Doctrine, or brought to live in meer ſuſpence concerning the truth of any Religion, like the Seekers. And if you miſtake thoſe Means to be effectual that are not, and thoſe that are effectual to be weak, or of a contrary effect, your Error in this will be a falſe Touch-ſtone to try other Doctrines, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you will readily approve of Errors, and refuſe the Truth; which hath been a pernicious occaſion of many Errors in Religion in late days: get but a true Touch-ſtone, by learning this Leſſon, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96243:11"/>you will be able to try the various Doctrines of <hi>Proteſtants, Papiſts, Arminians, Socinians, Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians, Quakers,</hi> and to diſcover the Truth, and cleave to it, with much ſatisfaction to your Judgment, amongſt all the Janglings and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of theſe times. Hereby you may diſcover whether the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us have in it any Sinews of <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> whether it be guilty of any inſufferable defect in Practical Principles, and deſerves to be altered and turned almoſt upſide down, with new Doctrines and Methods, as ſome learned Men in late time have judged by their Touchſtones.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly, It is alſo of great importance and neceſſity for our eſtabliſhment in holy practice: For we cannot apply ourſelves to the Practice of Holineſs with hope of ſucceſs, except we have ſome Faith concerning the Divine aſſiſtance, which we have no ground to expect, if we uſe not ſuch means as God hath appointed to work by. <hi>God meeteth them that remember him in his own ways,</hi> Iſai. 64.5. And <hi>makes a breach upon them that ſeek him not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the due order,</hi> 1 Chron. 15.13. He hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and ordained ſuch means of Sanctification and Salvation as are for his own Glory, and thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he bleſſeth to us; and he crowneth no Man that ſtriveth, except he ſtrive lawfully, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. Experience ſheweth plentifully both of Heathens and Chriſtians, how pernicious Ignorance, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking of theſe effectual Means are to an holy practice. The Heathens generally fell ſhort of an acceptable performance of thoſe Duties of the Law which they knew, becauſe of their ignorance in this point. Many Chriſtians content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with external performances, becauſe they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96243:11"/>never knew how they might attain to Spiritual Service. And many reject the way of Holineſs as auſtere and unpleaſant, becauſe they know not how to cut off a Right-hand, or pluck out a Right-eye, without intolerable pain; whereas they would find the ways of Wiſdom (if they knew them) <hi>to be ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths to be peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. This occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the putting off Repentance from time to time, as an uncouth thing. Many others ſet upon the Practice of Holineſs with a fervent Zeal, and run very faſt, but tread not a ſtep in the right way, and finding themſelves frequently diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overcome by their Luſts, they at laſt give over the Work, and turn to wallow again in the Mire, which hath occaſioned ſeveral Treatiſes, to ſhew how far a Reprobate may go in the way of Religion, whereby many weak Saints are diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, accounting that theſe Reprobates have gone further than themſelves; whereas moſt of them never knew the right way, nor trod one ſtep aright in it, <hi>for few there be that find it, Mat.</hi> 7.14. Some of theſe ignorant Zealots do inhumanly macerate their Bodies with faſting, and other auſterities to kill their Luſts, and when they ſee their Luſts are ſtill to hard for them, they fall into deſpair, and are driven by horrour of Conſcience to make away themſelves wickedly, to the ſcandal of Religion. Peradventure God may bleſs my diſcovery of the powerful Means of Holineſs, ſo far as to ſave ſome one or other from killing themſelves; and ſuch a Fruit as this would countervail my Labour; tho' I hope God will enlarge the Hearts of many by it, to run with great chearfulneſs, joy, and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the ways of his Commandments.</p>

               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>THoſe Means that are next to the attainment of the Great End aimed at, are firſt to be diſcovered, that we may learn how to get them by other means expreſſed in the following Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Therefore I have named here ſeveral Qualifications and Endowments that are neceſſary to make up that Holy Frame and State of the Soul, whereby it is furniſhed and enabled to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice the Law immediately, and that not only in the beginning, but in the continuation of that Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: and therefore note diligently, that theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments muſt continue in us during the preſent Life, or elſe our ability for an holy Life will be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96243:12"/>loſt, and they muſt be before Practice, not in any diſtance of time, but only as the Cauſe is before the Effect. I do not ſay, that I have named par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly all ſuch neceſſary Qualifications; but thus much I dare ſay, that he that gaineth theſe, may by the ſame means gain any other that ſhould be ranked with them. And this is a matter worthy of our ſerious conſideration; for few underſtand that any ſpecial Endowments are required to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us for an holy Practice, more than for other voluntary Actions. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had excellent Endowments beſtowed upon him for an holy Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, when he was firſt created according to the Image of God; and the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> had Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more excellent to enable him for an harder Task of Obedience. And ſeeing Obedience is grown more difficult, by reaſon of the oppoſition and temptations that it meeteth with ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> we that are to be Imitators of Chriſt, had need have very choice Endowments, as Chriſt had: at leaſt as good, or ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Adam</hi> had at firſt, as our Work is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than his. <hi>What King going to make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another king, ſitteth not down first, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulteth whether he be able with ten thouſand, to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thouſand?</hi> And ſhall we dare to ruſh into Battel againſt all the Powers of Darkneſs, all Worldly Terrors and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements? and our own inbred domineering Corruptions, without conſidering whether we have ſufficient Spiritual Furniture to ſtand in the Evil day? Yet many content themſelves with ſuch an ability to will and do their Duty, as they would have to be given to Men univerſally, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are no better enabled for the Spiritual Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96243:13"/>than the generality of the World, that lie van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed under the wicked One, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their ſtanding is not at all ſecured by it. It is an hard matter to find what this univerſal ability is, that ſo many contend ſo earneſtly for, of what it conſiſteth, by what means it is conveyed to us and maintained.</p>
               <p>Bodily Ability hath Spirits, Nerves, Ligaments, Bones to ſubſiſt by; but this Spiritual Univerſal Ability ſeemeth to be ſome occult Quality, that no ſufficient Account can be given how it is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or of what it is conſtituted: That none may deceive themſelves, and miſcarry in their Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes for Holineſs, by depending on ſuch a weak occult Quality, I have here ſhewed four Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which a true ability for the Practice of Holineſs muſt neceſſarily be conſtituted, and by which it muſt ſubſiſt and be maintained; intending to ſhew afterward, by what means they are given unto us, and whether the inclination or perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion here mentioned be perfect or imperfect. And they are of ſuch a myſterious nature, that ſuch as own the neceſſity of Endowments to frame them for Holineſs, are prone to think that leſs than theſe will ſerve, and that ſome of theſe frame us rather for Licentiouſneſs than Holineſs, as they are here placed before any actual performance of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law; and that ſome things contrary to them would put us into a better frame for Holineſs; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch ſurmiſes I ſhall endeavour ſuch a demonſtration of theſe Endowments particularly, as may gain the aſſent of right Reaſon, inſiſting on them in the ſame order wherein I have placed them in the Direction.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:96243:13"/>
               <p>In the firſt place, I aſſert that an Inclination and Propenſity of the Heart to the Duties of the Law, is neceſſary to frame and enable us for the immediate Practice of them; and I mean not ſuch a blind Propenſity as inanimate Creatures and Brutes have to their natural Operations, but ſuch an one as is meet for intelligent Creatures, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are by the Conduct of Reaſon prone and bent to approve and chuſe their Duty, and averſe to the Practice of Sin: And therefore I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated that the Three other Endowments men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Direction, are ſubſervient to this as the chief of all, which are ſufficient to make it a rational Propenſity. This is contrary to thoſe that out of Zeal for Obedience according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, contend ſo earneſtly for Free-will as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and ſufficient Endowment to enable us to perform our Duty, when once we are convinc'd of it, and of our Obligation to it, and that extol this Endowment as the great Benefit that Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Redemption hath bleſſed all Mankind with, though they Conſider this Free-will without any actual Inclination to Good; yea, they cannot but acknowledge that in moſt of Mankind that have it, it is encumbred with an actual Bent and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity of the Heart altogether to evil. Such a Free-will as this is, can never free us from Slavery to Sin and Satan, and fit us for the Practice of the Law, and therefore is not worthy the pains of thoſe that contend ſo hotly for it. Neither is the Will ſo free as is neceſſary for the Practice of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, until it be endued with an inclination and Propenſity thereunto, as may appear by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Arguments.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:96243:14"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Duties of the Law are of ſuch a nature, that they cannot poſſibly be performed while there is wholly an averſneſs or mere indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency of the Heart to the Performance of them, and no good Inclination and Propenſity toward the Practice of them: Becauſe the chief of all the Commandments, is to love the Lord with our whole Heart, Might and Soul, to love every thing that is in him, to love his Will and all his Ways, and to like them as good, and all Duties muſt be influenced in their Performance by this Love; we muſt delight to do the Will of God, it muſt be to us as our Meat and Drink, we muſt long and thirſt for it, it muſt be ſweeter to us than the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or honey comb,</hi> Pſal. 40.8.30.4, 34. Pſal. 63 1. and 119.20. and 19.10.</p>
               <p>And this Love, Likeing, Delight, Longing, Thirſting, Sweet-reliſhing muſt be continued to the end; and the firſt indeliberate Motions of Luſt muſt be regulated by Love to God and our Neighbour; and Sin muſt be luſted againſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and abhorred, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. If it were true Obedience (as ſome would have it) to love our Duty only, as a Market-man loveth foul Ways to the Market, or as a Sick man loveth an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant medicinal Potion, or as a Captive Slave loveth his hard Work for fear of a greater Evil; then it might be performed with averſeneſs of Inclination; but we muſt love it as the Market-man Gain, as the Sick man Health, as pleaſant Meat and-Drink, as the Captive Liberty. Doubtleſs there can be no Power in the Will, for this kind of Service without an Agreeablene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> of our Inclination to the Will of God, a Heart according to his own Heart, an Averſeneſs of our Hearts from Sin, and a kind
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96243:14"/>of Antipathy againſt Sin; for we know the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Like loveth like;</hi> there muſt be an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Perſon or thing beloved to the Diſpoſition of the Lover. <hi>Love to God muſt flow from a clean heart,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. Cleanſed from evil Propenſities and Inclinations, and Reaſon will tell us, that the firſt Motions of Luſt which fall not under our Choice and Deliberation, cannot be avoided without a fixed Propenſity of the Heart to Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The Image of God (wherein God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his infinite Wiſdom judged it meet to frame the firſt <hi>Adam in righteouſneſs, and true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and uprightneſs,</hi> Gen. 1.27. Epheſ. 4.24. Eccleſ. 7.29.) conſiſted in an actual Bent and Propenſity of his Heart to the Practice of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not in a mere Power of Will to chuſe Good or Evil: For this in it ſelf is neither holy nor unholy, but only a Ground-work, on which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Image of God or of Satan, may be drawn; nor in an indifference of Propenſity to the choice of Sin or Duty, for this is a wicked Diſpoſition in an intelligent Creature that knoweth his Duty, and fitteth us only to halt betwixt God and <hi>Baal.</hi> God ſet <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul at firſt wholly in a right Bent and Inclination, though <hi>Adam</hi> might act contrary to it if he would; as we may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to do ſome things contrary to our natural or rational Inclinations, and it is eaſie to fail of our Duty though great Preparation and Furniture be required for the Performance of it. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> alſo, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>was born an holy thing,</hi> Luke 1 35. with an holy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his Soul and Propenſity to Goodneſs; and can we reaſonably hope to ariſe to the Life
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96243:15"/>of Holineſs, from which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> fell; or to be Imitators of Chriſt, ſince Duty is made ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult by the Fall, if we be not renewed in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure according to the ſame Image of God, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with ſuch a Propenſity and Inclination.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly, Original Corruption (whereby we are dead to God and Godlineſs from the Birth, and made willing Slaves to the performance of all actual Sins, until the Son of God make us free) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſteth in a Propenſity and Inclination of the Heart to Sin, and Averſeneſs to Holineſs. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Propenſity to Sin, what can that <hi>Law of ſin in our members</hi> be, <hi>that warreth against the law of our mind, and leadeth us captive to the ſervice of ſin?</hi> Rom. 7.23. What is that Poiſon in us, for which Men may be called <hi>ſerpents, vipers?</hi> What is that <hi>Spirit of whoredoms in men, by reaſon of which they will not frame their doings to turn to God?</hi> Hoſ. 5.4. How is the <hi>tree first corrupt,</hi> and then <hi>its fruit corrupt?</hi> Matth. 12.33. How can Man be ſaid to be <hi>abominable and filthy, that drinketh ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity like water?</hi> Job 15.16. How ſhould the <hi>mind of the fleſh be continual enmity to the Law of God?</hi> Rom. 8.7. I know there is alſo a blindneſs of Underſtanding, and other things belonging to Original Corruption, which conduceth to this evil Propenſity of the Will, but yet this Propenſity it ſelf is the great evil, the indwelling Sin which produceth all actual Sins, and muſt of neceſſity be removed or reſtrained, by reſtoring that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Inclination, wherein the Image of God confiſted, or elſe we ſhall be backward and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate to every good work, and whatever Freedom the Will hath, ſhall be employed only in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Sin.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:96243:15"/>
               <p n="4">4ly, God reſtoreth his People to Holineſs, by giving to them, <hi>a new heart, a new ſpirit, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the heart of ſtone out of their fleſh, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them an heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 36.26, 27. And he <hi>circumciſeth their heart to love him with their whole heart and Soul.</hi> And he requireth that we ſhould be transformed <hi>in the renewing of our mind, that we may prove what is his acceptable will,</hi> Rom. 12.2. And <hi>David</hi> prayeth for the ſame end, <hi>that God would create in him a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit within him,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. If any one can judge that this new, clean, circumciſed Heart, this Heart of Fleſh, this new right Spirit is ſuch an one as hath no actual Inclination and Propenſity to good, but only a Power to chuſe good or evil, undeſervedly call'd Free-will, with a preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to evil, or an indifference of Propenſity to both contraries, it will not be worth my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to convince ſuch a Judgment, only let him conſider whether <hi>David</hi> could account ſuch an Heart to be clean and right, when he prayeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.36. <hi>Incline mine heart to thy teſtimonies, and not to coveteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Endowment neceſſary to enable us for the immediate Practice of Holineſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the other two that follow, to work in us a rational Propenſity to this Practice, is that we be well perſwaded of our Reconciliation with God. We muſt reckon that the breach of Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which Sin hath made betwixt God and us, is made up by a firm Reconciliation to his Love and Favour; and herein I include the great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Juſtification, as the means whereby we are reconciled to God, which is deſcribed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96243:16"/>either by forgiving our Sins, or by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Righteouſneſs to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, 6, 7. becauſe both are contained in one and the ſame juſtifying Act; as one act of Illumination com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends expulſion of Darkneſs and introduction of Light, one act of Repentance containeth Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of Sin, and vivification to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and every Motion from any thing to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is but one and the ſame, though it may be expreſſed by divers Names, with reſpect to either of the two contrary terms, the one of which is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, the other introduced by it. This is a great Myſtery (contrary to the Apprehenſions, not only of the Vulgar, but of ſome learned Divines,) that we muſt be reconciled to God, and juſtified by the Remiſſion of our Sins, and imputation of Righteouſneſs before any ſincere Obedience to the Law, that we may be enabled for the Practice of it. They account that this Doctrine tendeth to the Subverſion of an holy Practice, and is a great Pillar of <hi>Antinemianiſm;</hi> and that the only way to eſtabliſh ſincere Obedience, is to make it rather a condition to be performed before our actual Juſtification and Reconciliation with God. Therefore ſome late Divines have thought ſit to bring the Doctrine of former Proteſtants concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtification to their Anvil, and to hammer it into another form that it might be more free from <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> and effectual to ſecure an holy Practice; but their Labour is vain and pernicious, tending to <hi>Antinemian</hi> profaneneſs, or painted Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſice at beſt; neither can the true Practice of Holineſs be ſecure, except the Perſwaſion of our Juſtification and Reconciliation with God be firſt obtained without works of the law, that we may
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96243:16"/>be enabled thereby to do them, as I ſhall now prove by ſeveral Arguments, intending alſo to ſhew in the following Directions, that ſuch a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the Love of God, as God giveth to his People, tendeth only to Holineſs, though a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwaſion of it be in many an Occaſion of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> When the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was framed for the Practice of Holineſs at his Creation, he was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Favour of God, and had no Sin im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him, and was accounted righteous in the ſight of God, according to his preſent ſtate, becauſe he was made upright according to God's Image, and there is no reaſon to doubt but that theſe Qualifications were his advantage for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Practice, and the Wiſdom of God judged them good for that end, and as ſoon as he loſt them, he became dead in ſin. The ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> alſo in our nature was the Beloved of the Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous in the ſight of God, without the Imputation of any Sin to him, except what his Office was to bear on the behalf of others. And can we reaſonably expect to be Imitators of Chriſt by performing more difficult Obedience than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s was before the Fall, except the like Advantages be given to us, by Reconciliation and Remiſſion of Sins, and imputation of a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs given by God to us when we have none of our own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe that know that natural Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under the Power of Sin and Satan, are fully convinced, that if God leave them to their own Hearts, they can do nothing but Sin, and that they can do no good work except it pleaſe God of his great Love and Mercy to work it in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:96243:17"/>them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.36. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8. Therefore that they may be encouraged and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally enclined to Holineſs, they muſt hope that God will work ſavingly in them. Now I leave it to conſiderate Men to judge, whether ſuch an Hope can be well grounded without a good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of ſuch a Reconciliation and Saving-love of God to us, as dependeth not upon any prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent goodneſs of our Works, but is a cauſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to produce them effectually in us: Yea, we know further, if we know our ſelves ſufficiently, that our Death in Sin proceeded from the Guilt of the firſt Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Sentence denounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. And that it is ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in us by the Guilt of Sin, and the Curſe of the Law, and that Spiritual Life will never be given us to free us from that Dominion, except this Guilt and Curſe be removed from us, which is done by actual Juſtification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. And this is ſufficient to make us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of living to God in Holineſs, while we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our ſelves to be under the Curſe and Wrath of God, by reaſon of our Tranſgreſſions and Sins ſtill lying upon us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The nature of Duties of the Law is ſuch, as requireth an Apprehention of our Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, and his hearty Love and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards us for the doing of them. The great Duty is Love to God with our whole Heart, and not ſuch a contemplative Love, as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers may have to the Object of Sciences, which they are concern'd in no further than to pleaſe their Fancies in the knowledge of them; but a practical Love whereby we are willing that God ſhould be abſolute Lord and Governour of us and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96243:17"/>all the World, to diſpoſe of us and all others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Will, as to our temporal and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Condition, and that he ſhould be the only Portion and Happineſs of all thoſe that are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; a Love whereby we like every thing in him as he is our Lord, his Juſtice as well as any other Attribute, without wiſhing or deſiring that he were better than he is, and whereby we deſire that his Will may be done upon us and all others, whether for Proſperity or Adverſity, Life or Death, and whereby we can heartily praiſe him for all things, and delight in our Obedience to him, in doing his Will, though we ſuffer that which is never ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to us, even preſent Death. Conſider theſe things well and you may eaſily perceive that our Spirits are not in a fit frame for the doing of them, while we apprehend our ſelves under the Curſe and Wrath of God, or while we are under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Suſpitions that God will prove an Enemy to us at laſt. Slaviſh Fear may extort ſome ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh hypocritical Performances from us, ſuch as that of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in letting the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> go ſore againſt his Will; but the Duty of Love cannot be extorted and forced by Fear, but it muſt be won and ſweetly allured by an Apprehenſion of God's Love and Goodneſs towards us, as that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, loving and beloved Diſciple teſtifieth; 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>There is no fear in love; but perfect love caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out fear, becauſe fear hath torment: He that feareth is not made perfect in love, we love him becauſe he first loved us.</hi> Obſerve here that we cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand with God in loving him before we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his Love to us. And conſult your own Experience, if you have any true Love to God, whether it were not wrought in you by a ſenſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96243:18"/>of God's Love firſt toward you. All the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency of God cannot render him an amiable Object to us, except we apprehend him an agreeable good to us. I queſtion not but the Devils know the excellency of Gods Nature, as well as our greateſt Metaphyſical Speculators, and this doth but fill them the more with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting horror and trembling that is contrary to Love, <hi>Ja.</hi> 2.19. The greater God's Excellency and Perfection is, the greater Evil he is to us if he hate us and curſe us; and therefore the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Self-preſervation deeply rooted in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, hindreth us from loving that which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend as our own Deſtruction; if a Man be an Enemy to us, we can love him for the ſake of our loving reconciled God, becauſe his Love will make Man's Hatred to work for our good; but if God himſelf be our Enemy, for whoſe ſake can we love him? Who is there that can free us from the evil of his Enemity and turn it to our Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, until he be pleaſed to reconcile himſelf to us?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our Conſcience muſt of neceſſity be firſt purged from dead works that we may ſerve the living God, and this is done by actual Remiſſion of Sin, procured by the Blood of Chriſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to our Conſciences, as appeareth by Chriſt's dying for this end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14, 15. and 10.1, 2. 4. 14, 17, 22. That Conſcience whereby we judge our ſelves to be under the guilt of ſin and wrath of God is accounted an evil Conſcience in Scripture, though it perform its Office truly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is cauſed by the evil of ſin, and will it ſelf be a cauſe of our committing more ſin, until it can judge us to be juſtified from all ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96243:18"/>into the Favour of God. Love, which is the end of the Law, muſt proceed from a good Conſcience, as well as from any other cleanneſs of Heart, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>David</hi>'s Mouth could not be opened to ſhew forth the Praiſe of God, until he was delivered from Blood-guiltineſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14, 15. This evil guilty Conſcience, whereby we judge that God is our Enemy, and that his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is againſt us to our everlaſting Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by reaſon of our ſins, doth ſtrongly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and increaſe the Dominion of Sin and Satan in us, and worketh moſt miſchievous effects in the Soul againſt Godlineſs, even to bring the Soul to hate God, and to wiſh there were no God, no Heaven, no Hell, ſo we might eſcape the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due to us. It ſo diſaffecteth People toward God, that they cannot endure to think, or ſpeak or hear of him and his Law, but ſtrive either to put him out of their minds by fleſhly Pleaſures and worldly Imployments, and thus they are alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from all true Religion, only blinding it, and ſtopping the mouth of it. It produceth Zeal in many outſide religious Performances, and alſo falſe Religion, Idolatry, and the moſt inhumane Superſtitions in the World. I have often conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by what manner of working any Sin could effectually deſtroy the whole Image of God in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and I conclude it was by working firſt an evil guilty Conſcience in him, whereby he judged that the juſt God was againſt him, and curſed him for that one Sin, and this was enough to work a ſhameful Nakedneſs by diſorderly Luſts, a turning his Love wholly from God to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a deſire to be hidden from the Preſence of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8, 10. which was a total Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96243:19"/>of the Image of God's Holineſs. And we have cauſe to judge that from the ſame cauſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the continual Malice, Rancour, Rage, Blaſphemy of the Devil, and many notorious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, againſt God and Godlineſs. Some may think <hi>Job</hi> uncharitable in ſuſpecting not meerly, that his Sons had ſinned, but that they had been ſo abominably wicked as to curſe God in their Hearts, <hi>Job</hi> 1.5. but <hi>Job</hi> well underſtood that if the guilt of any ordinary Sin lie upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it will make the Soul to wiſh ſecretly that God were not, or that he was not ſo juſt a Judge, which is a ſecret Curſing of God, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided until our Conſciences be purged from the guilt of Sin, by the offering of Chriſt for us, which was then figured out by the Burnt-offerings of <hi>Job</hi> for his Sons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God hath abundantly diſcovered to us in his Word, that his method in bringing Men from Sin to Holineſs of Life, is firſt to make them know that he loveth them, and that their Sins are blotted out. When he gave the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> he firſt diſcovered himſelf to be their God, that had given them a ſure Pledge of his Salvation by their Delivery from <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the Preface, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. And du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all the time of the Old Teſtament, God was pleaſed to make the entrance into Religion to be by Circumciſion, which was not only a Sign, but alſo a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God juſtifieth People, while they are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.5. and this Seal was adminiſtred to Children of eight Days old, before they could perform any Condition of ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for their Juſtification, that their Furniture for
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96243:19"/>an holy Practice might be ready before hand. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore in the time of the Old Teſtament, God appointed divers Waſhings, and the Blood of Bulls and Goats, and the Aſhes of an Heifer ſprinkling the unclean, to prepare and ſanctifie them for other Parts of his Worſhip in his Tabernacle and Temple, to figure out his purging of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead works by the Blood of Chriſt, that they might ſerve the living God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.9, 10, 13, 14, 22. This I ſay was then figurative Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as the word Sanctification is taken in a large Senſe, comprehending all things that prepare us for the Service of God, chiefly the Remiſſion of Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10, 14, 18. Though if it be taken in a ſtrict ſence, reſpecting only our Conformity to the Law, it muſt neceſſarily be placed after Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, according to the uſual Method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines. God alſo minded them of the neceſſity of purging away their guilt firſt, that their Service might be acceptable, by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to offer the Sin-offering before the Burnt-offering, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.8. and 16.3, 11. And leaſt the guilt of their Sins ſhould pollute the Service of God, notwithſtanding all their particular Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, God was pleaſed to appoint a general Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all their Sins one day every Year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Scape goat was to bear upon him all their Iniquities, unto a Land not inhabited, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.22. 34. Under the New Teſtament God uſeth the ſame Method in loving us firſt, and waſhing us from our Sins by the Blood of Chriſt, that he may make us Prieſts to offer the Sacrifices of Praiſe and all good Works to God even the Father. He entreth us into his Service by waſhing away our ſins in Baptiſm, he ſeedeth and ſtrengtheneth us for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:96243:20"/>his Service by Remiſſion of Sins given to us in the Blood of Chriſt at the Lord's Supper, He exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to obey him, becauſe he hath already loved us, and our Sins are already pardoned. <hi>Forgive one another even as God for Chriſts ſake hath forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you. Be ye therefore followers of God as dear children, and walk in love as Christ hath loved us,</hi> Epheſ. 4.32. and 5.1, 2. <hi>I write unto you little children becauſe your ſins are forgiven you for his name ſake. Love not the world, neither the things of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2.12, 15. I might quote abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Texts of the ſame nature. We may clearly ſee by all this, that God hath accounted it a matter of great Importance, and hath condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to take wonderful care in providing plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful means both under the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his People might be firſt cleanſed from guilt, and reconciled to himſelf, to fit them for the acceptable Practice of Holineſs. Away then with all the contrary Methods of the new Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>The Third Endowment neceſſary to enable us for the Practice of Holineſs, without which a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of our Reconciliation with God, would be of little efficacy to work in us a rational Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to it, is that we be perſwaded of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Enjoyment of the everlaſting heavenly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. This muſt precede our holy Practice as a cauſe diſpoſing and alluring us to it. This Affer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ſeveral ſorts of Adverſaries to oppoſe it; ſome account that a Perſwaſion of our own future Happineſs before we have perſevered in ſincere Obedience, tendeth to Licentiouſneſs, and that the way to do good Works, is rather to make them a Condition neceſſary for the procuring of this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96243:20"/>Perſwaſion. Others condemn all Works, that we are allured or ſtirred up to by the future Enjoyment of the heavenly Happineſs, as legal, mercenary, flowing from ſelf-love, and not from any pure Love to God, and they figure out ſincere Godlineſs by a Man bearing Fire in one hand to burn up Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Water in the other to quench Hell, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that the true Service of God muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at all from hope of Reward or ſear of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but only from Love. To eſtabliſh the Truth aſſerted againſt theſe Errors that are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it and to each other, I ſhall propoſe the enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The nature of the Duties of the Law is ſuch, that they cannot be ſincerely and univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiced without this Endowment. That this Endowment muſt be preſent in us is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently proved already by all that I have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the neceſſity of the Perſwaſion of our firm Reconciliation with God by our Juſtification, to prepare us for this Practice, becauſe that inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a Perſwaſion of this future Happineſs, or elſe it is of little worth. All that I have to add here is, that ſincere Obedience cannot rationally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, except it be allured, encouraged, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by this Perſwaſion. Let me therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Sadducee believing no Happineſs after this Life, and put the Queſtion, Can ſuch an one love God with his whole Heart, Might and Soul? Will he not think it reaſonable rather to leſſen and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate his Love towards God, leſt he ſhould be overmuch troubled to part with him by Death? We account it moſt reaſonable to ſit looſe in our Affections from things that we muſt part with. Can ſuch an one be ſatisfied with the Enjoyment
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96243:21"/>of God as his Happineſs? Will he not rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the Enjoyment of God and all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Duties are Vanities as well as other things, becauſe in a little time we ſhall have no more Benefit by them than if they had never been? How can ſuch an one be willing to lay down his Life for the ſake of God, when by his Death he muſt part with God as well as with other things? How can he willingly chuſe Afflictions rather than Sin, when he ſhall be more miſerable in this Life for it, and not at all happy hereafter. I grant if Affliction come unavoidably upon ſuch a Perſon, he may reaſonably judge that Patience is better for him than Impatience; but it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him that he is forced to the uſe of ſuch a Virtue, and he will be prone to fret and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at his Creator, and to wiſh he had never been, rather than to endure ſuch miſeries, and to be comforted only with vain tranſitory Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The ſure Hope of the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is made uſe of ordinarily by God ſince the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> for the Practice of Holineſs, as the Scripture doth abundantly ſhew, <hi>Christ the great pattern of holineſs for the joy that was ſet before him, endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12.2. And though I cannot ſay that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had ſuch a ſure Hope to preſerve him in Innocency yet he had inſtead of it, the preſent Poſſeſſion
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96243:21"/>of an earthly Paradice and an happy Eſtate in it, which he knew would laſt if he continued in Holineſs, or be changed into a better Happineſs. The Apoſtles did not faint under Affliction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew that it worked for them <hi>a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.16, 17. The believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, knowing in themſelves that they had an Heaven a better and more enduring Subſtance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> accounts all his Sufferings unprofitable were it not for a glorious Reſurrection, and that Chriſtians would be of all Men moſt miſerable, and that the Doctrine of the <hi>Epicures</hi> were rather to be choſen, <hi>Let us eat and drmk, for to morrow we ſhall die.</hi> And he exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be <hi>abundant in the work of the Lord, knowing that</hi> their <hi>labour ſhall not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.58. As worldly Hope keepeth the World at work in their various Employments; ſo God giveth his People the Hope of his Glory to keep them cloſe to his Service, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. And it is ſuch a ſure Hope as ſhall never make them aſhamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.28. Thoſe that think it below the excellency of their Love to work out of Hope of the Heavenly Reward, do thereby advance their Love beyond the Love of the Apoſtles and Primitive Saints, and even of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, This perſwaſion of our future enjoyment of everlaſting Happineſs, cannot tend to Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, if we underſtand well that perfect Holineſs is a neceſſary part of that Happineſs, and that tho' we have a Title to that Happineſs by free Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Adoption, yet we muſt go to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it in a way of Helineſs, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96243:22"/>Neither is it legal or mercenary to be moved by this Perſwaſion, ſeeing the Perſwaſion it ſelf is not gotten by the Works of the Law, but by free Grace through Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. And if it be a working out of ſelf-love; yet for certain it is not that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſelf-love, which the Scripture condemneth as the Mother of Sinfulneſs, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. but an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſelf-love enclining us to prefer God above the Fleſh and the World, ſuch as God directeth us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when he exhorteth us to ſave our ſelves, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. And it is ſo far from being contrary to the pure Love of God, that it brings us to love God more purely and entirely. The more good and beneficial we apprehend God to us to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doubtleſs the more lovely God will be to us, and our Affections will be the more enflamed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. God will not be loved as a barren Wilderneſs, a Land of Darkneſs to us, neither will he be ſerved for nought, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.31. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 45.19. He would think it a Diſhonour to him to be owned by us as our God, if he had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us a City, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. And he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to love him by the Cords of a Man, ſuch Cords as the Love of Men uſeth to be drawn by, even by his own Love to us, in laying his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits before us, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. Therefore the way for us to keep our ſelves in the Love of God, is to look for his Mercy unto eternal Life, <hi>Jude.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>The laſt Endowment, for the ſame end as the former is, that we be well perſwaded of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Strength both to will and perform our Duty acceptably, until we come to the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the heavenly Happineſs. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Error of thoſe that account it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96243:22"/>if we have ſtrength to practice Holineſs, if we will, or to will it if we pleaſe, and this is the ſufficient ſtrength which they earneſtly contend for, as a great Benefit beſtowed on all Mankind by univerſal Redemption. It is alſo contrary to the Error of thoſe that think the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Godlineſs and Wickedneſs to be alike eaſie, excepting only ſome difficulty in the firſt Alterations of vicious Cuſtoms, and in bearing Perſecutions, which they account to be a rare Caſe, ſince the Kingdoms of the World have been brought to the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, or that think that God requireth of Men only to do their Endeavour, that is, what they can do, and it is nonſence to ſay they cannot do what they can do. According to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is needleſs to concern our ſelves much about ſufficient Strength for holy Practice. For the confirmation of the Aſſertion againſt theſe Errours take theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We are by nature dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins unable to will, or do any thing that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually good, notwithſtanding the Redemption that is by Chriſt, until we be actually quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8, 9. Thoſe that are ſufficiently enlightned and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, know themſelves to be naturally in this Caſe; and that they do not want only executive Power to do good, but chiefly an Heart to will it, and to be pleaſed with it, and that if God work not in them both to will and to do, they ſhall neither will nor do any thing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. And that if he leave them to their own Corruption after he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96243:23"/>the good Work, they ſhall certainly prove vile Apoſtates, and their latter end will be worſe than their beginning. We may conclude from hence, that whoſoever can couragiouſly attempt the Practice of the Law without being well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of a ſufficient Power whereby he may be enabled to be heartily willing as well as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form when he is willing, until he hath gone through the whole Work of Obedience accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſuch an one was never yet truly humbled and brought to know the Plague of his own Heart, neither doth he truly believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Original Sin, whatever formal Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he makes of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thoſe that think ſincere Conformity to the Law in ordinary Caſes to be ſo paſſing eaſie, ſhew that they neither know it nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Is it an eaſie thing to wreſtle, not againſt Fleſh only, but <hi>againſt principalities, powers, ſpiritual wickedneſs in high Places?</hi> Epheſ. 6.12. Is it an eaſie thing not to luſt or covet according to the Tenth Commandment? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> found it ſo difficult to obey this Commandment, that his Concupiſcence prevailed the more by occaſion of the Commandment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7, 8. Our work is not only to alter vicious Cuſtoms, but to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie corrupt natural Affections which bred thoſe Cuſtoms, and not only to deny the fulfilling of ſinful Luſt, but to be full of holy Luſt and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, that even the reſtraining the execution of corrupt Luſts, and croſſing them by contrary Actings, is in many caſes like <hi>the cutting off of a right hand, and plucking out a right eye,</hi> Mat. 5.29, 30. If Obedience be ſo eaſie, how came it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96243:23"/>to paſs that the Heathens generally did thoſe things for which their own Conſciences condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them as worthy of Death? <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. And many among us ſeek to enter into this <hi>ſtrait gate, and are not able,</hi> Luke 13.24. And break ſo many vows and Purpoſes of Obedience, and fall back to the Practice of their Luſts, though in the mean time the Fears of eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſs hard upon their Conſciences?</p>
               <p>As to thoſe that find Perſecution for Religion to be ſo rare a thing in late days, they have cauſe to be ſuſpected, that they are of the World, and therefore the World loveth his own, elſe they would find that national Profeſſion of Religion will not ſecure thoſe that are truly godly from ſeveral ſorts of Perſecutions. And ſuppoſe Men do not perſecute us for Religion, yet there is great Difficulty in bearing great Injuries from Men on other Accounts, and Loſſes, Poverty, bodily Pains, long Diſeaſes and untimely Deaths, from the ordinary Providence of God, with ſuch hearty Love to God and to injurious Men for his ſake, and ſuch a patient acquieſcence in his Will as the Law of God requireth. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the work of God is eaſie and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to thoſe whom God rightly furniſheth with Endowments for it; but thoſe that aſſert it to be eaſie to Men in their common Condition, ſhew their Imprudence in contradicting the general Experience of Heathens and Chriſtians. Though many Duties do not require much labour of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Mind, and might be done with eaſe, if we were willing, yet it is eaſier to remove a Mountain, than to move and encline the Heart to will and affect the doing of them. I need
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96243:24"/>not concern my ſelf with thoſe that account that all have ſufficient Strength for an holy Practice, becauſe they can do their endeavour, that is, what they can do; for God requireth actual ſulfilling of his Commands. What if by our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours we can do nothing in any meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule, ſhall the Law be put off with no Performance? and ſhall ſuch Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours be accounted ſufficient Holineſs? And what if we cannot ſo much as endeavour in a right way? If Man's Ability were the meaſure of acceptable Duty, the Commands of the Law would ſignifie very little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Wiſdom of God hath ever funiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People with a good Perſwaſion of a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Strength, that they might be enabled both to will and do their Duty. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was furniſhed with ſuch a Strenght, and we have no cauſe to think that he was ignorant of it, or that he needed to ſear that he ſhould be left to his own Corruptions, becauſe he had no Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in him, until he had produced them in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by ſinning againſt Strength, and when he had loſt that Strength, he could not recover the Practice of Holineſs, until he was acquainted with a better Strength, whereby the Head of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſhould be bruiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Our Lord Chriſt doubtleſs knew the inſinite Power of his Diety to enable him for all that he was to do and ſuffer in our Nature. He knew the Lord God would help him, therefore he ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 50.7. The Scripture ſheweth what plentiful Aſſurance of Strength God gave to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Joſhua, Gideon,</hi> when he called them to great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:96243:24"/>Imployments, and to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when he called them to ſubdue the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Chriſt would have the Sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> to conſider whether they were able to <hi>drink of his cup,</hi> and to <hi>be baptized with the baptiſm</hi> that he <hi>was baptized with,</hi> Matth. 20.22. <hi>Paul</hi> encourageth Believers to the Life of Holineſs, by perſwading them that ſin ſhall not prevail to get the Dominion over them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they <hi>are not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.13, 14. And he exhorteth them to be <hi>ſtrong in the Lord and in the power of his might, that</hi> they <hi>might be able to ſtand against the wiles of the divel,</hi> Epheſ. 6.10, 11. <hi>John</hi> exhorteth Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers <hi>not to love the world, nor the things of the world, becauſe they were ſtrong and had overcome the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one,</hi> 1 Jo. 2.14, 15. They that were called of God heretofore to work Miracles, were firſt acquainted with the gift of Power to work them, and no wiſe Man will attempt to do them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge of the Gift: Even ſo when Men that are dead in Sin are call'd to do the works of holy Life, which are in them great Miracles, God maketh a Diſcovery of the gift of Power unto them, that he may encourage them in a rational way to ſuch a wonderful Enterpriſe.</p>

                     <hi>The way to get holy. Endowments and Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary to frame and enable us for the immediate Practice of the Law, is to receive them out of the fulneſs of Christ, by Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him; and that we may have this Fellowſhip, we must be in Christ, and have Christ himſelf in us, by a Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with him.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>HEre, as much as any where, we have great cauſe to acknowledge with the Apoſtle, that without Controverſie great is the Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, even ſo great that it could not have entred into the Heart of Man to conceive it, if God had not made it known in the Goſpel by ſupernatural Revelation. Yea, tho' it be revealed clearly in the holy Scriptures, yet the Natural Man hath not Eyes to ſee it there, for it is fooliſhneſs to him; and if God expreſs it never ſo plainly and properly, he will think that God is ſpeaking Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles and Parables. And I doubt not but it is ſtill a Riddle and Parable even to many truly Godly, that have received an holy Nature in this way: For the Apoſtles themſelves had the ſaving benefit of it before the Comforter diſcovered it clearly to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96243:25"/>them, <hi>John</hi> 14, 20. And they walked in Chriſt, as the way to the Father, before they clearly knew him to be the way, <hi>John</hi> 14.5. And the beſt of us know it but in part, and muſt wait for the perfect knowledge of it in another World. One great Myſtery is, that the holy frame and diſpoſition whereby our Souls are furniſhed and enabled for immediate Practice of the Law, muſt be gotten by receiving it out of Chriſt's fulneſs, as a thing already prepared and brought to an exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for us in Chriſt, and treaſured up in him; and that as we are juſtified by a righteouſneſs wrought out in Chriſt, and imputed to us, ſo we are ſanctified by ſuch an holy frame and qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as are firſt wrought out, and compleated in Chriſt for us, and then imparted to us: and as our natural corruption was produced originally in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and propagated from him to us; ſo our new nature and holineſs is firſt produced in Chriſt, and derived from him to us, or as it were propagated. So that we are not at all to work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Chriſt, in making or producing that holy frame in us, but only to take it to ourſelves, and uſe it in our holy Practice, as made ready to our hands. Thus we have fellowſhip with Chriſt in recovering that holy frame of Spirit that was originally in him: for fellowſhip is when ſeveral Perſons have the ſame things in common, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. This Myſtery is ſo great, that notwithſtanding all the Light of the Goſpel, we commonly think that we muſt get an holy frame by producing it a new in ourſelves, and by forming and working it out of our own Hearts. Therefore many that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly devout, take a great deal of pains to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96243:26"/>their corrupted Nature, and beget an holy frame of Heart in themſelves, by ſtriving earneſtly to maſter their ſinful luſts, and by preſſing vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their Hearts many motives to Godlineſs, labouring importunately to ſqueeze good qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of them, as Oyl out of a Flint. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that tho' they be juſtified by a righteouſneſs wrought out by Chriſt, yet they muſt be ſanctifi'd by a holineſs wrought out by themſelves. And thô out of humility they are willing to call it infuſed Grace, yet they think they muſt get the infuſion of it by the ſame manner of working, as if it were wholly acquired by their endeavours. On this account they acknowledge the entrance into a Godly Life to be harſh and unpleaſing, becauſe it coſts ſo much ſtrugling with their own Hearts and Affections to new frame them, if they knew that this way of entrance is not only harſh and unpleaſant, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together impoſſible, and that the true way of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying ſin, and quickning themſelves to holineſs, is by receiving a new nature out of the fulneſs of Chriſt, and that we do no more to the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a new nature, than of original ſin, tho' we do more to the reception of it. If they knew this, they might ſave themſelves many a bitter agony, and a great deal of miſpent burdenſome labour, and employ their endeavours to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, in ſuch a way as would be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſucceſsful.</p>
               <p>Another greater myſtery in the way of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the glorious manner of our Fellowſhip with Chriſt in receiving an holy frame of heart from him. It is by our being in Chriſt, and having Chriſt himſelf in us, and that not meerly by his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96243:26"/>univerſal preſence, as he is God, but by ſuch a cloſe union as that we are one ſpirit, and one fleſh with him, which is a priviledge peculiar to thoſe that are truly ſanctified. I may well call this a myſtical union, becauſe the Apoſtle calleth it a great myſtery, in an Epiſtle full of Myſteries, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.20. intimating, that it is great, eminently above many other Myſteries; it is one of the three My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Unions that are the chief Myſteries in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: the other two are the Union of the Trinity of Perſons in One Godhead, and the Union of the Divine and Human Natures in One Perſon, Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man. Though we cannot frame an exact Idea of the manner of any of theſe Three Unions in our Imaginations, becauſe the depth of theſe Myſteries is beyond our Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, yet we have cauſe to believe them all, becauſe they are clearly revealed in Scripture, and are a neceſſary Foundation for other Points of Chriſtian Doctrine, particularly this Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and Believers, is plainly in ſeveral places of Scripture, affirming that Chriſt is, and <hi>dwelleth in believers, and they in him,</hi> Joh. 6.56. <hi>and</hi> 14.20. And that they are ſo joyned together as to become one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. And that Believers are Members of Chriſt's Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones; and they two, Chriſt and the Church, are <hi>one fleſh,</hi> Eph. 5.30, 31. Furthermore, this Union is illuſtrated in Scripture by various reſemblances, which would be very much unlike the things which they are made uſe of to reſemble, and would rather ſeem to beguile us by obſcuring the Truth, than inſtruct us by illuſtrating of it, if there were no true proper Union betwixt Chriſt and Believers. It is reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96243:27"/>by the Union betwixt God the Father and Chriſt, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.20. and 17.21, 22, 23. betwixt the Vine and its Branches, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. betwixt the Head and Body, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.22.23. betwixt Bread and the Eater, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51, 53, 54. It is not only reſembled but ſealed in the Lords Supper, where neither the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor the <hi>Lutherans</hi> Conſubſtantiation, nor the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſpiritual Preſence of Chriſt's Body and Blood to the true Receivers can ſtand without it, and if we can imagine that Chriſt's Body and Blood are not truely eaten and drunk by Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers either ſpiritually or corporally, we ſhall make the Bread and Wine joyned with the Words of Inſtitution, not only naked Signs, but ſuch Signs as are much more apt to breed falſe Notions in us, than to eſtabliſh us in the Truth. And there is nothing in this Union ſo impoſſible or repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reaſon, as may force us to depart from the plain and familiar ſence of thoſe Scriptures that expreſs and illuſtrate it. Though Chriſt be in Heaven and we on Earth, yet he can joyn our Souls and Bodies to his at ſuch a diſtance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubſtantial Change of either, by the ſame inſinite Spirit dwelling in him and us, and ſo our Fleſh will become his, when it is quickned by his Spirit, and his Fleſh ours as truly as if we did eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood, and he will be in us himſelf by his Spirit who is one with him, and who can unite more cloſely to Chriſt than any material Subſtance can do, or who can make a more cloſe and intimate Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and us. And it will not follow from hence that a Believer is one Perſon with Chriſt, any more than that Chriſt is one Perſon
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96243:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>with the Father by that greater myſtical Union. Neither will a Believer be hereby made God's, but only the Temple of God, as Chriſt's Body and Soul is, and the Spirits lively Inſtrument, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the principal Cauſe? Neither will a Believer be neceſſarily perfectin Holineſs here by, or Chriſt made a Sinner, for Chriſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to dwell in a Believer by certain mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and degrees, and to make them holy ſo far only as he dwelleth in them. And though this Union ſeem too high a Preferment for ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Creatures as we are, yet conſidering the preciouſneſs of the Blood of God whereby we are redeemed, we ſhould diſhonour God if we ſhould not expect a miraculous Advancement to the higheſt Dignity that Creatures are capable of through the Merits of that Blood. Neither is there any thing in this Union contrary to the Judgment of Senſe, becauſe the Bond of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being Spiritual, falleth not at all under the Judgment of Senſe.</p>
               <p>Several learned Men of late acknowledge no other Union betwixt Chriſt and Believers, than ſuch as perſons or things wholly ſeparated, may have by their mutual relations each to other, and accordingly they interpret the places of Scripture that ſpeak of this Union. When Chriſt is called the Head of the Church, they account that a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Head or Governour is the thing meant when Chriſt is ſaid to be in his People, and they in him, they think that the proper meaning is, that Chriſt's Law, Doctrine, Grace, Salvation, or that Godlineſs is in them, and embraced by them; ſo that Chriſt here muſt not be taken for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96243:28"/>Chriſt himſelf, but for ſome other thing wrought in them by Chriſt. When Chriſt and Believers are ſaid to be one Spirit and one Fleſh, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of the Agreement of their Minds and Affections, as if the greatneſs of the Myſtery of this Union mentioned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.32. conſiſted rather in a harſh Hope, or a dark improper Expreſſion, than in the depth and abſtruceneſs of the thing it ſelf, and as if Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had affected obſcure intricate Expreſſions, when they ſpeak to this Church of things very plain and eaſie to be underſtood. Thus that great Myſtery the Union of Believers with Chriſt himſelf, which is the Glory of the Church, and hath been highly owned formerly both by the ancient Fathers, and many eminent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines, particular Writers concerning the Doctrine of the Lord's Supper, and by a very general Conſent of the Church in many Ages, is now exploded out of the new Model of Divinity. The Reaſon of exploding it, as I judge in Charity, is not becauſe our late learned Refiners of Divinity think themſelves leſs able to defend it than the other two myſterious Unions, and to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Objections of thoſe proud Sophiſters that will not believe what they cannot comprehend; but rather becauſe they account it to be one of the Sinnews of <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> that lay unobſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the former uſual Doctrine; that it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to puff up Men with a Perſwaſion that they are juſtified, and have eternal Life in them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that they need not depend any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon their uncertain Performances of the <hi>Condition of ſincere Obedience for Salvation,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they account the very Foundation of a holy
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96243:28"/>Practice to be ſubverted. But the Wiſdom of God hath laid another manner of Foundation for an holy Practice than they imagine, of which <hi>this Union, (which the Builders refuſe)</hi> is a <hi>principal ſtone</hi> next to the <hi>head of the corner.</hi> And in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to their corrupt Gloſſes upon the Scriptures that prove it, I aſſert that our <hi>Union with Christ is the cauſe of our Subjection to Christ</hi> as a <hi>Political Head</hi> in all things, and of the abiding of his Law, Doctrine, Grace, Salvation, and all Godlineſs in us, and of our Agreement with him in our Minds and Affections, and therefore it cannot be altogether the ſame thing with them. And this Aſſertion is uſeful for a better Underſtanding of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this Union. It is not a Priviledge procured by <hi>our ſincere Obedience and Holineſs,</hi> as ſome may imagine, or a <hi>reward of good works</hi> reſerved for us in another World; but it is a Priviledge beſtowed upon Believers in their very <hi>first entrance into an holy ſtate,</hi> on which all ability to do good works doth depend, and all ſincere Obedience to the Law doth follow after it as Fruit produced by it.</p>
               <p>Having thus far explained the Direction, I ſhall now ſhew, that though the Truth contained in it be above the Search of Natural Reaſon, yet it is evidently diſcovered to thoſe that have their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings opened to diſcern that ſupernatural Revelation of the myſterious way of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God hath given to us in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> There are ſeveral Places in Scripture that do plainly expreſs it; ſome Texts ſhew th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The Apoſtle ſheweth that the holy Nature whereby we live to God, was firſt <hi>produced in him by his death and reſurrection, in whom alſo ye are circumciſed in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, buried with him, quickened together with him when you were dead in your ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 1.3. Who <hi>hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly places in Christ.</hi> An holy Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with all its neceſſary Qualifications, muſt needs be comprehended here in all ſpiritual Bleſſings, and theſe are given us in <hi>Chriſt's Perſon</hi> in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places, as prepared and treaſured up in him for us while we are upon Earth, and therefore we muſt have our <hi>holy Endowments</hi> out of him, or not at all. In this Text ſome chuſe rather to read <hi>heavenly things,</hi> as in the Margent, becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places nor things are expreſſed in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; but the former textual reading is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Marginals as being the proper Senſe of the Original Greek Phraſe, which is, and muſt neceſſarily be ſo rendred in two other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this ſame Epiſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.10. &amp; 6.12. Another Text is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. which ſheweth that <hi>Christ is of God made unto us Sanctification,</hi> by which we are able to walk holily as well as wiſely, by the Wiſdom of which we are ſavingly wiſe, and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> by the Imputation of which we are juſtified, and <hi>Redemption whereby we are</hi> redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96243:29"/>from all Miſery, to the Enjoyment of his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as our Happineſs in the heavenly Kingdom. Other Texts of Scripture ſhew plainly that we receive our Holineſs out of his fulneſs by Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Of his fulneſs have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi> And it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of Grace anſwerable to the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which muſt needs include the Grace of Sanctification, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Christ.</hi> God is Light, <hi>if we walk in the light, as he is in the light we have fellowſhip one with another.</hi> Hence we may infer that our Fellowſhip with God and Chriſt doth include particularly our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Light, and walking in it holily and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. There are other Texts that reach the Proof of the whole Direction fully, ſhewing not only that our holy Endowments are made ready firſt in Chriſt for us, and receiv'd from, but that we receive them by Union with Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Ye have put on the new man, which is renewed after the image of him that created him,</hi> where Chriſt is all and in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.11, 12. <hi>This is the recerd that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son hath not life.</hi> Can we deſire that God ſhould more clearly teach us, that all the fulneſs of the New Man is in Chriſt, and all that ſpiritual nature and Life whereby we live to God in Holineſs, and that they are fixed in him ſo inſeparably, that we can not have them except we be joyned to him, and have himſelf abiding in us? Take heed leſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:96243:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>through Prejudice and Hardneſs of Heart, you be guilty of making God a Liar in not believing this eminent Record that God hath given to us of his Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God is pleaſed to illuſtrate this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious manner of our Sanctification by ſuch variety of Similitudes and Reſemblances, as may put us out of doubt that it is Truth, and ſuch a Truth as we are highly concern'd to know and believe. I ſhall endeavour to contract the chief of theſe Reſemblances, and the force of them, briefly into one Sentence, leaving it to thoſe that are Spiritual to enlarge their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon them. We receive from Chriſt a <hi>new holy frame and nature,</hi> whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled for an holy Practice by union and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, in like manner as Chriſt lived in our nature by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.57. As we receive <hi>original ſin and death</hi> propagated to us from <hi>the first Adam,</hi> Rom. 5.12, 14, 16, 17. as the natural Body receiveth Senſe, Motion, Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Head, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.19. As the Branch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth its Sap, Juiceand fructifying Virtue from the Vine, <hi>Jo.</hi> 15.4, 5 As the Wife bringeth forth Fruit by Virtue of her Conjugal Union with her Husband, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. As Stones become an holy Temple by being built upon the Foundation and joyned with <hi>the chief corner-ſtone,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6. As we receive the nouriſhing Virtue of Bread by eating it, and of Wine by drinking it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51, 55, 57. Which laſt Reſemblance is uſed to ſeal to us our Communion with Chriſt in the Lords Supper. Hear are ſeven Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances inſtanced whereof ſome do illuſtrate the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:96243:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>Myſtery ſpoken of more fully than others, all of them do ſome way intimate that our New Life and Holy Nature is firſt in Chriſt, and then in us, by a true proper Union and Fellowſhip with him. If any ſhould urge that the Similitude of <hi>Adam</hi> and his Seed, and of married Couples, do make rather for a Relative, than a real Union betwixt Chriſt and us; let them conſider that all Nations are really made of one Blood which was firſt in <hi>Adam, Acts</hi> 17.26. and that the firſt Woman was made out of the Body of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> and was really <hi>bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh,</hi> and by this firſt married Couple the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Union of Chriſt and his Church is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently reſembled, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.22, 23, 24. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30, 31, 32. And yet it ſuppoſeth both theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances in the nearneſs and fulneſs of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe that are joyned to the Lord are not only one Fleſh, but one Spirit with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The end of Chriſt's Incarnation, Death and Reſurrection, was to prepare and form an holy Nature and Frame for us in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to be communicated to us by Union and Fellowſhip with him; and not to enable us to produce in our ſelves the firſt Original of ſuch an holy Nature by our own Endeavours. By his Incarnation there was a Man created in a new holy Frame, after the Holineſs of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Frame had been marred and aboliſhed by the firſt Tranſgreſſion, and this new Frame was far more excellent than ever the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s was; becauſe Man was really joyned to God by a cloſe inſeparable Union of the divine and humane Nature in one Perſon of Chriſt, ſo that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:96243:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>theſe Natures had Communion each with other in their Actings, and Chriſt was able to act in his humane Nature, by Power proper to the divine Nature, wherein he was one God with the Father. The words that he ſpake while he was upon Earth, he ſpoke not of himſelf by any meer humane Power, but the Father that dwelt in him, he did the Works, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10. Why was it that Chriſt ſet up the fallen Nature of Man in ſuch a wonderful Frame of Holineſs, in bringing of it to live and act by Communion with God living and acting in it? One great End was, that he might communicate this excellent Frame to his Seed that ſhould be born of him and in him, by his Spirit as the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> the quickning Spirit, that as we have born the Image of the earthly Man, ſo we might alſo bear the Image of the heavenly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45, 49. in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs here, and in Glory hereafter. Thus he was born <hi>Emanuel</hi> God with us, becauſe the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead with all Holineſs did firſt dwell in him bodily, even in his humane Nature, that we might be filled up with that fulneſs in him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9, 10. Thus he came down from Heaven as living Bread, that as he liveth by the Father, ſo thoſe that eat him may live by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51, 56. By the ſame Life of God in them that was firſt in him.</p>
               <p>By his Death he freed himſelf from the Guilt of our Sins imputed to him, and from all that innocent Weakneſs of his humane Nature, which he has born for a time for our ſakes. And by freeing himſelf he prepared a Freedom for us from our whole natural Condition, which is both
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:96243:31"/>weak as his was, and alſo polluted with our Guilt and ſinful Corruption. Thus the corrupt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State, which is called in Scripture the <hi>Old Man,</hi> was crucified together with Chriſt, that the Body of Sin might be deſtroyed. And it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in us, not by any Wounds that we our ſelves can give to it, but by our partaking of that Freedom from it and Death unto it, that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wrought out for us by the Death of Chriſt, as is ſignified by our Baptiſm, wherein we are buried with Chriſt by the Application of his Death to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4, 10, 11. God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh for Sin, (or by a Sacrifice for Sin, as in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent) condemned Sin in the Fleſh, that the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us that walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. Obſerve here that though Chriſt died that we might be juſtified by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God and of Faith, not by our own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4, 5, 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. yet he died alſo that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, and that by walking after his Spirit, as thoſe that are in Chriſt, <hi>Rom. ibid.</hi> He is reſembled in his Death to a Corn of Wheat dying in the Earth, that it may propagate its own nature, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth much Fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.24. to the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover that was ſlain, that a Feaſt might be kept upon it, and to Bread broken, that it may be Nouriſhment to thoſe that eat it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8. and 11.24. To the Rock ſmitten that Water may guſh out of it for us to drink, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. He died that he might make of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> one New Man in himſelf, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.15. and that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96243:32"/>he might ſee his ſeed, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as derive their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature from him, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.10. Let theſe Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures be well obſerved, and they will ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence that Chriſt died, not that we might be able to form an holy Nature in our ſelves, but that we might receive one ready prepared and formed in Chriſt for us by Union and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him.</p>
               <p>By his Reſurrection he took Poſſeſſion of Spiritual life for us, as now fully procured for us, and made to be our Right and Property, by the Merit of his Death, and therefore we are ſaid to be quickned together with Chriſt, even when we were dead in ſins, and to be raiſed up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, and to be made to ſit together in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Places in Chriſt Jeſus as our Head, while we continue upon Earth in our own Perſons, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.5, 6. His Reſurrection was our Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to the Life of Holineſs, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall was our Fall into ſpiritual Death; and we are not our ſelves the firſt makers and formers of our new holy Nature any more than of our Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Corruption, but both are formed ready for us to partake of them. And by Union with Chriſt we partake of that ſpiritual Life that he took Poſſeſſion of for us at his Reſurrection, and thereby we are enabled to bring forth the Fruits of it, as the Scripture ſheweth by the Similitude of a Marriage Union, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. We are mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to him that is riſen from the Dead, that we might bring forth Fruit unto God. Baptiſm ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the Application of Chriſt's Reſurrection to us as well as his Death; we are raiſed up with him in it to newneſs of Life, as well as buried
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96243:32"/>with him, and we are taught thereby that becauſe he died unto ſin once and liveth unto God, we ſhould likewiſe reckon our ſelves to be dead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed unto Sin, and alive unto God through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4, 5, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our Sanctification is by the Holy Ghoſt, by whom we live and walk holily, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. Now the Holy Ghoſt firſt reſted on Chriſt in all fulneſs that he might be communicated from him to us, as was ſignified to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt by the Similitude of the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Dove from the opened Heavens reſting on Chriſt at his Baptiſm, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32.33. And when he ſanctifieth us he baptizeth us into Chriſt, and joyneth us to Chriſt by himſelf, as the great Bond of Union, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. So that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptural Phraſe, it is all one to have Chriſt himſelf and to have the Spirit of Chriſt in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9, 10. He glorifieth Chriſt, for he receiveth thoſe things that are Chriſt's, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14, 15. He giveth us an experimental Knowledge of thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings which he himſelf prepared for us by the Incarnation, Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The effectual Cauſes of thoſe four prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Endowments, which in the foregoing Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction were aſſerted, neceſſary to furniſh us for the immediate Practice of Holineſs, are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fulneſs of Chriſt, and treaſured up for us in him; and the Endowment themſelves, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Cauſes, are attained richly by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Fellowſhip with Chriſt. If we be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, our Hearts will be no longer left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:96243:33"/>the Power of ſinful Inclinations, or in a meer indifferency of Inclination to good or evil, but they will be powerfully endued, with a Power, Bent, and Propenſity to the Practice of Holineſs by the Spirit of Chriſt dwelling in us, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us to mind ſpiritual things, and to luſt againſt the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1, 4, 5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. And we have in Chriſt a full Reconciliation with God, and an Advancement into higher Favour with him than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had in the State of Innocency, becauſe the Righteouſneſs that Chriſt wrought out for us by his Obedience unto Death, is imputed to us for our Juſtification, which is called the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God, becauſe it was wrought by one that is God as well as Man, and therefore it is of an infinite value to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God for all our ſins, and to procure his Pardon and higheſt Favour for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. And that we may be perſwaded of this Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, we receive the Spirit of Adoption through Chriſt, <hi>whereby we cry, Abba, Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15. Hereby alſo we are perſwaded of our future En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, of the everlaſting heavenly Happineſs, and of ſufficient Strength both to will and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Duty acceptably, until we come to that Enjoyment. For the Spirit of Adoption teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to conclude, that if we be the Children of God, then we are heirs of God, joynt-heirs with Chriſt. And that the Law of the Spirit of Life that is in Chriſt Jeſus, maketh us free from the Law of Sin and Death, and that nothing ſhall be againſt us, nothing ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of God in Chriſt, but in all oppoſition and difficulties that we meet with, we ſhall be at laſt <hi>more than conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours through him that loved us,</hi> Rom. 8.17.23, 35,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:96243:33"/>37, 39. Furthermore this comfortable Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Juſtification and future Happineſs, and all ſaving Priviledges <hi>cannot tend to licentiouſneſs,</hi> as it is given only in this <hi>way of Union</hi> with Chriſt, becauſe it is joyned inſeparably with the <hi>Gift of Sanctification,</hi> by the Spirit of Chriſt, ſo that we cannot have Juſtication, or any ſaving Priviledge in Chriſt, except we receive Chriſt himſelf, and his Holineſs, as well as any other Benefit, as the Scripture teſtifieth that <hi>there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jeſus, who walk not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh but after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Whereas it may be doubted, whether the Saints that lived before the coming of Chriſt in the Fleſh, could poſſibly be one Fleſh with him, and receive a new Nature by Union and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, as prepared for them in his fulneſs, we are to know that the ſame Chriſt that took our Fleſh was before <hi>Abraham, Joh.</hi> 8.58. and was fore-ordained before the Foundation of the World, to be ſacrificed as a Lamb without blemiſh, that he might redeem us from all iniquity by his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Blood, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. and he had the ſame Spirit, then which filled his humane Nature with all its fulneſs afterwards, and raiſed it from the dead, and he gave that Spirit then to the Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. &amp; 3.18, 19. Now this Spirit was able and effectual to unite thoſe Saints to that Fleſh which Chriſt was to take to himſelf in the fulneſs of Time, becauſe he was the ſame in both, and to give out to them, that Grace with which Chriſt would afterwards fill his Fleſh for their Salvation, as well as ours. Therefore <hi>David</hi> accounted Chriſt's Fleſh to be his, and ſpake of Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, as his own before
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96243:34"/>hand, as fully as any of us can do ſince their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.9, 10, 11. <hi>My fleſh alſo ſhall rest in hope, for thou wilt not leave my ſoul in hell,</hi> neither <hi>wilt thou ſuffer thine holy one to ſee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, thou wilt ſhew me the path of life.</hi> Yea, and Saints before <hi>Davids</hi> time, <hi>did all eat of the ſame ſpiritual meat, and drink of the ſame ſpiritual drink,</hi> even of the ſame Chriſt as we do, and therefore were Partakers of the ſame Priviledge of Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4. And when Chriſt was manifeſted in the Fleſh, in the fulneſs of time, all things in Heaven and on Earth, all the Saints departed whoſe Spirits <hi>were then made perfect</hi> in Heaven, as well as the Saints that then were, or ſhould afterward be on Earth, were <hi>gathered together in one, and comprehended in Chriſt, as their Head,</hi> Epheſ. 1.10. And he was the chief <hi>corner-ſtone in whom the building of the whole Church upon the foundation of the Prophets</hi> before, and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after his comming being <hi>fitly fromed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 2.20, 21. <hi>Jeſus Christ is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. <hi>His incarnation, death, and reſurrection were the cauſe</hi> of all the Holineſs that ever was, or ſhall be given to Man, from the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to the end of the World, and that by the mighty Power of his Spirit whereby all Saints that ever were or ſhall be, are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be Members of that one myſtical Body whereof he is the Head.</p>

               <p>THAT which I aſſerted in the foregoing Direction, concerning the neceſſity of our being in Chriſt, and having Chriſt in us, by a myſtical Union, to enable us for an holy Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, might put us to a ſtand in our Endeavours for Holineſs, becauſe we cannot imagine how we ſhould be able to raiſe our ſelves above our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sphere, to his glorious Union and Fellowſhip, until God be pleaſed to make known to us, by ſupernatural revelation, the means whereby his
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96243:35"/>Spirit maketh us Partakers of ſo high a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. But God is pleaſed to help us at a ſtand to go on forward, by revealing two Means or Inſtruments, whereby his Spirit accompliſheth the myſtical Union and Fellowſhip betwixt Chriſt and us, and whereby rational Creatures are capable of attaining thereunto, by his Spirit working in them. One of theſe Means is the Goſpel of the Grace of God, wherein God doth make known to us the <hi>unſearchable Riches of Chriſt, and Chriſt in us the hope of Glory, Eph.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. and doth alſo invite us, and command us to believe on Chriſt for his Salvation, and doth encourage us by a free Promiſe of that Salvation, to <hi>all that believe on him, Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 11. This is God's own Inſtrument of Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, wherein he ſendeth Chriſt <hi>to us, to bleſs us with his Salvation, Acts</hi> 3.26. <hi>It is the miniſtration of the ſpirit, and of righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 8, 9. <hi>Faith cometh by the hearing of it, and therefore it is a great inſtrument whereby we are begotten in Chriſt, and Chriſt is formed in us, Rom.</hi> 10.16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. There is no need for us to ſay in our Hearts, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, to bring Chriſt down from above? Or, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into the deep, to bring up Chriſt from the dead, that we may be united, and have fellowſhip with him in his death and reſurrection? For the word is nigh to us, the Goſpel, the word of Faith, in which Chriſt himſelf graciouſly condeſcendeth to be nigh to us;</hi> ſo that we may come at him there, without going any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if we deſire to be joyned to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>The other of theſe means is <hi>Faith,</hi> that is wrought in us by the Goſpel: This is <hi>our Inſtrument of Reception,</hi> whereby the Union
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:96243:35"/>betwixt Chriſt and us is accompliſhed on our part by our actual receiving of Chriſt himſelf, with all his Fulneſs, into our Hearts; which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Subject of the preſent Explanation.</p>
               <p>The Faith which Philoſophers commonly treat of, is only an <hi>Habit</hi> of the Underſtanding, whereby we aſſent to a Teſtimony upon the Authority of the Teſtifier: Accordingly ſome would have Faith in Chriſt to be no more than a believing the truth of things in Religion, upon the authority of Chriſt teſtifying them; but the Apoſtle ſheweth, that the Faith whereby we are juſtified, is Faith in Chriſt's Blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25. not only in his Authority as a <hi>Teſtifier.</hi> And tho' a meer aſſent to a Teſtimony were ſufficient Faith for knowledge of things, which the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers aimed at, yet we are to conſider, that the Deſign of Saving Faith is not only to know the Truth of Chriſt and his Salvation, teſtified and promiſed in the Goſpel, but <hi>alſo to apprehend and receive Chriſt and his Salvation, as given by and with the Promiſe.</hi> Therefore Saving Faith muſt neceſſarily contain two Acts, <hi>believing the Truth of the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>believing on Chriſt,</hi> as promiſed freely to us in the Goſpel for all Salvation. By the one it receiveth <hi>the Means</hi> wherein Chriſt is conveyed to us; by the other it <hi>receiveth Chriſt himſelf</hi> and his Salvation in the Means. As it's one act to receive the Breaſt or Cup wherein Milk or Wine are conveyed, and another act to ſuck the Milk in the Breaſt, and to drink the Wine in the Cup, and both theſe acts muſt be perform'd heartily with an unfeigned love to the Truth, and a deſire of Chriſt and his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above all things; this is our ſpiritual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96243:36"/>which is neceſſary for our eating and drinking Chriſt, the Food of Life, as a natural Appetite is for Bodily Nouriſhment. Our aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto, or believing the Goſpel, muſt not be forced by meer conviction of the Truth, ſuch as wicked Men and Devils may be brought to, when they had rather it were falſe: Neither muſt our believing on Chriſt be only conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for fear of Damnation without any hearty Love and Deſire towards the enjoyment of him, but we muſt receive the Love of the Truth, by reliſhing the Goodneſs and Excellency of it; and <hi>we muſt account all things loſs for the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and count them but dung, that we may win Chriſt, and be found in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chriſt to be <hi>all our Salvation and Happineſs, Col.</hi> 3.11. <hi>in whom all fulneſs doth dwell, Col.</hi> 1.19. And this Love muſt be to every part of Chriſt's Salvation, to Holineſs as well as Forgiveneſs of Sins. We muſt deſire earneſtly, that God would create in us <hi>a clean Heart, and right Spirit, as well as hide his face from our ſins, Pſal.</hi> 51.9, 10. not like many, that care for nothing in Chriſt but only Deliverance from Hell. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled, Mat.</hi> 5.6. The former of theſe Acts doth not immediately <hi>unite us</hi> to Chriſt, becauſe it is terminated only on the <hi>means of Conveyance,</hi> the Goſpel, yet it is a <hi>ſaving Act,</hi> if it be rightly performed, becauſe it enclineth and diſpoſeth the Soul to the latter Act, whereby Chriſt himſelf is immediately received into the Heart. He that believeth the Goſpel with hearty love and liking, as the moſt Excellent Truth, will certainly with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:96243:36"/>the like heartineſs believe on Chriſt for his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. They that <hi>know the name of the Lord, will certainly put their truſt in him, Pſal.</hi> 9.10. Therefore in Scripture, Saving-Faith is ſometimes deſcribed by the former of theſe Acts, as if it were a meer believing the Goſpel; ſometimes by the latter, as a believing on Chriſt or in Chriſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou believe in thine heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> 11, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt is born of God.</hi> 13, <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that you may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the better underſtanding of the nature of Faith, let it be further obſerved, that the Second and Principal of it, <hi>believing on Chriſt,</hi> includeth believing on God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, becauſe they are one and the ſame infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, and they all concurr in our Salvation by Chriſt, as the only Mediator betwixt God and us, <hi>in whom all the promiſes of God are yea and amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. <hi>By him, as mediator, we believe on God that raiſed him from the dead, and gave him glory, that our faith and hope might be in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And it is the ſame thing with truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God or on the Lord, which is ſo highly commended in the whole Scripture, eſpecially in the Old Teſtament, as may eaſily appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it hath the ſame Cauſes, Effects, Objects, Adjuncts, Oppoſites, and all the ſame Circumſtances, excepting only that it had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Chriſt, as promiſed before his Coming,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96243:37"/>and now it reſpecteth him, as already come in the Fleſh. Believing in the Lord, and truſting on his Salvation, are equivalent terms, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain one another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.22. I confeſs, that truſting on things ſeen or known by the meer Light of Reaſon, as on our own Wiſdom, Power, Riches, on Princes, or any Arm of Fleſh, may not ſo properly be called believing on them, but truſting on a Saviour, as diſcovered by a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is properly believing on him. It is alſo the ſame thing that is expreſſed by the terms of reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, relying, leaning, ſtaying our ſelves on the Lord, becauſe it is the Ground of that Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is the proper Act of <hi>Hope,</hi> though our Believing and Truſting be for the preſent as well as future benefit of this Salvation. The reaſon why it is ſo commonly expreſſed in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the New Teſtament, by the terms of <hi>believing on Chriſt,</hi> might be probably becauſe when that part of Scripture was written, there was cauſe in a ſpecial manner to urge believing the Teſtimony that was then newly revealed by the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus explained the nature of Faith, I come now to aſſert its proper Uſe and Office in our Salvation, That <hi>it is the Means and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby we receive Chriſt, and all his Fulneſs, actually into our Hearts.</hi> This excellent Uſe and Office of Faith is encountered by a multitude of Errors; men naturally eſteem, that it is too ſmall and ſlight a thing to produce ſo great effects; as <hi>Naaman</hi> thought waſhing in <hi>Jordan</hi> too ſmall a matter for the cure of his Leproſie. They contemn the true means of entring in at
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96243:37"/>the ſtreight Gate, becauſe they ſeem too eaſie for ſuch purpoſe, and thereby they make the Entrance not only difficult, but impoſſible to themſelves. Some will allow, that Faith is the <hi>ſole Condition of our Juſtification, and the Inſtrument to receive it,</hi> according to the Doctrine maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned formerly by the Proteſtants againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, but they account, that it is not ſufficient or effectual to <hi>Sanctification,</hi> but that it rather tendeth to <hi>Licentiouſneſs,</hi> if it be not joyned with ſome other means, that may be powerful and effectual to procure an holy Practice. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this great Doctrine of Proteſtants as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Cordial for Perſons upon their Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds, or in Agonies under Terrors of Conſcience, but they account, that it is not good for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Food, and that it is Wiſdom in Miniſters to preach it ſeldom and ſparingly, and not without ſome Antidote or Corrective to prevent the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs to which it tendeth. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Antidote or Corrective is, That Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſſary to Salvation as well as Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that though we be juſtified by Faith, yet we are ſanctified by our own performance of the Law; and ſo they ſet up Salvation by works, and make the Grace of Juſtification to be of none effect, and not at all comfortable. If it had indeed ſuch a malignant influence upon Practice, it could not be owned as a Doctrine proceeding from the moſt holy God, and all the Comfort that it affords muſt needs be ungroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and deceitful. This Conſequence is well underſtood by ſome late Refiners of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, and therefore they have thought fit to new-model this Doctrine, and to make
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96243:38"/>Saving-Faith to be only <hi>a Condition to procure a Right and Title to our Juſtification by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt,</hi> which muſt be performed before we can lay any good claim to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, and before we have any right to the actual receiving of it; and this they call an accepting of, or receiving Chriſt. And that they may the better ſecure the practice of Holineſs by their Conditional Faith, they will not have truſting on God or Chriſt for Salvation to be accounted the principal Saving-act of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it ſeemeth to them, many looſe wicked People truſt on God and Chriſt for their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as much as others, and are by their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hardened the more in their Wickedneſs: But they had rather it ſhould be Obedience to all Chriſt's Laws, at leaſt, in their Reſolution, or a <hi>Conſent that Chriſt ſhould be their Lord, accepting of his terms of Salvation, and a reſignation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his Government in all things.</hi> It is a ſign that the Scripture-form of Teaching is grown into diſeſteem with our great Maſters of Reaſon, when truſting in the Lord, ſo much commended in Scripture, is accounted a mean and ordinary thing. They endeavour to affright us from owning Faith to be an Inſtrument of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by telling us, that thereby we that uſe the Inſtrument are made our own principal Juſtifiers to the diſhonour of God; though it might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwered, that we are made thereby only the principal receivers of our own Juſtification from God, the Giver of it, to whom all the Glory doth belong.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:96243:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>All theſe Errors will fall, if it can be proved, that ſuch a Faith as I have deſcribed is an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby we actually receive Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into our Hearts, and Holineſs of Heart and Life, as well as Juſtification by Union and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with him. For the proof of it, I ſhall offer the following Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> By Faith we have the actual enjoyment and poſſeſſion of Chriſt himſelf, and not only of Remiſſion of Sins, but of Life, and ſo of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: <hi>Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. We live to God, and yet not we, but <hi>Chriſt liveth in us by the Faith of the Son of God, Gal.</hi> 2.19. 20. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the Son and everlaſting life that is in him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>He that heareth Chriſt's word, and believeth on him that ſent Chriſt, hath everlaſting life, and is paſſed from death unto life.</hi> Theſe Texts expreſs clearly ſuch a Faith as I have deſcribed; therefore the efficiency or operation of Faith, in order to the enjoyment of Chriſt and his Fulneſs, cannot be the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a bare Right or Title to this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, but rather it muſt be an entrance into it, and taking poſſeſſion of it. <hi>We have our acc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs and entrance by faith into that Grace of Chriſt wherein we ſtand, Rom.</hi> 5.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scripture plainly aſcribeth this effect to Faith, that by it we receive Chriſt, put him on, are rooted and grounded in him, and alſo that we receive the Spirit, <hi>remiſſion of ſins, and an inheritance among them which are ſanctified, John</hi> 1.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26, 27. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.14.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96243:39"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. And the Scripture illuſtrateth this Receiving by the Similitude of Eating and Drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; <hi>He that believeth on Chriſt, drinketh the living water of his ſpirit, John</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. <hi>Chriſt is the bread of life, his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed;</hi> and the way to eat and drink it, is to believe in Chriſt, and by ſo doing we dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us, and have everlaſting Life, <hi>John</hi> 6.35, 47, 48, 54, 55, 56. How can it be taught more clearly, that we receive Chriſt himſelf properly into our Souls by Faith, as we do receive Food into our Bodies by eating and drinking, and that Chriſt is as truly united to us thereby as our Food when we eat or drink it? So that Faith cannot be <hi>a Condition</hi> to procure a meer Right or Title to Chriſt, no more than Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or Drinking procureth a meer Right or Title to our Food, but it is rather <hi>an Inſtrument</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, as the Mouth that eateth and drinketh the Food.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Chriſt with all his Salvation is freely given by the Grace of God, to all that believe on him; for we are ſaved by Grace through Faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the Giſt of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>We are juſtified freely by his Grace, through Faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 8.24. The Holy Ghoſt, who is the Bond of Union betwixt Chriſt and us, is a Gift, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. Now that which is a Gift of Grace muſt not be at all earned, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, or procured by any Work or Works per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed as a Condition to get a right Title to it; and therefore Faith it ſelf muſt not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a Condition. If it be by Grace, it is no more of Works, <hi>otherwiſe Grace is no more
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96243:39"/>Grace, Rom.</hi> 11.1. The Condition of a free Gift is only take and have; and in this ſence we will readily acknowledge Faith to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, allowing a Liberty in Terms where we agree in the thing; but if you give a Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn to purchaſe a Title to it, then you ſpoil the freeneſs of the Gift. The free Offer of Chriſt to you is ſufficient to conferr upon you a Right, yea, to make it your Duty to receive Chriſt and his Salvation as yours; and becauſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt by Faith as a free Gift, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may account Faith to be the Inſtrument, and as it were the Hand whereby we receive him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It hath been already proved, that all ſpiritual Life and Holineſs is treaſured up in the Fulneſs of Chriſt, and communicated to us by Union with him; therefore the accompliſhing of Union with Chriſt is the firſt work of Saving Grace in our Hearts, and Faith itſelf, being an holy Grace, and part of ſpiritual Life, cannot be in us before the beginning of it, but rather it is given to us, and wrought in the very working of the Union. And the way wherein it condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to the Union, cannot be by procuring a meer Title to Chriſt as a Condition, becauſe then it ſhould be performed before the uniting Work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth; but rather by being an Inſtrument, whereby we may actively receive and embrace Chriſt, who is already come into the Soul to take poſſeſſion of it his own Habitation.</p>
               <p>True Saving-Faith, ſuch as I have deſcribed, hath in its nature and manner of Operation a
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96243:40"/>peculiar aptitude or fitneſs to receive Chriſt and his Salvation, and to unite our Souls unto him, and to furniſh the Soul with a new holy Nature, and to bring forth an holy Practice by Union and Fellowſhip with him. God hath fitted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inſtruments for their Office, as the Hands, Feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that we may know by their nature and natural manner of operation, for what uſe they are deſigned. In like manner we may know, that Faith is an Inſtrument formed on purpoſe for our Union with Chriſt, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, if we conſider what a peculiar fitneſs it hath for the Work. The diſcovery of this is of great uſe for the underſtanding of the myſterious manner of our receiving and practiſing all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt. By this precions Grace of Faith, and to make you as it were to ſee with your Eyes, that it is ſuch an Inſtrument as I have aſſerted it to be, I ſhall preſent it to your view in three particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The Grace of Faith is as well fitted for the Souls receiving of Chriſt and Union with him, as any Inſtrument of the Body is for receiving and cloſing with things needful for it. By the very act of hearty truſting or believing on Chriſt for all Salvation and Happineſs, the Soul heaveth and putteth away from itſelf every thing that keepeth it at a diſtance from Chriſt, as all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in our own Strength, Endeavours, Works, Privileges, or in any Worldly Pleaſures, Profits, Honours, or in any humane Helps and Succours for our Happineſs and Salvation. Becauſe ſuch Confidences are inconſiſtent with our Confidence in Chriſt for all Salvation, <hi>Paul</hi> by his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96243:40"/>in Chriſt was taken off from all Conſidence in the Fleſh; he ſuffer'd the loſs of glorying in his Privileges, legal Righteouſneſs, and counted all other Enjoyments in matters of the World or of Religion, to be but Dung, that he might win Chriſt, and be found in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 6, 7, 8, 9. the voice of Faith is, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we ride upon Horſes, neither will we ſay any more to the work of our hands, ye are our God; for in thee the Fatherleſs find mercy, Hoſ.</hi> 14.3. <hi>We have no might againſt this great company of our ſpiritual Enemies; neither know we what to do, but our eyes are upon thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. I might multiply places of Scripture, to ſhew what a ſelf emptying Grace Faith is, and how it caſteth other Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences out of the Soul, by getting above them to Chriſt, as the only Happineſs and Salvation. The ſame act of truſting or believing on Chriſt, or on God, is the very manner of our Souls co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.35. <hi>drawing near to the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 73.28. <hi>fleeing unto the Lord to hide us, Pſal.</hi> 143.9. <hi>making our reſuge in the ſhadow of his wings, Pſal.</hi> 57.1. <hi>ſtaying our ſelves and our minds upon the Lord, Iſa.</hi> 50.10. &amp; 26.3. <hi>laying hold of eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>lifting up our ſelves to the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 51.1, 2. <hi>rolling our way, and caſting our burden upon the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 37.5. &amp; 55.22. and of our eating and drinking Chriſt, as hath already appeared. Let us conſider, that Chriſt and his Salvation cannot be ſeen, or handled, or attained to by any bodily motion, but are revealed and promiſed to us in the Word. Now let any invent if they can, any way for the Soul to exerciſe any motion or activeneſs, in receiving of this unſeen promiſed Salvation, beſides believing the Word,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96243:41"/>and truſting on Chriſt for the Benefit promiſed. If Chriſt were to be earned by Works, or any other kind of Conditional Faith than this, yet a Faith muſt be inſtrumental to receive him. Some think Love as ſit to be the uniting Grace, but I have ſhewed, that Love to Chriſt's Salvation is an Ingredient into Faith: And though Love be an Appetite unto Union, yet we have no other likely way to fill this Appetite, while we are in this World, beſides truſt on Chriſt for all his Benefits as he is promiſed in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, There is in this Saving-Faith a natural Tendency, to furniſh the Soul with an holy Frame and Nature, and all Endowments neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto, out of the Fulneſs of Chriſt. An hearty affectionate truſſing on Chriſt for all his Salvation, as freely promiſed to us, hath natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough to work in our Souls a rational bent, and inclination to, and ability for the Practiſe of all Holineſs, becauſe it comprehendeth in it a <hi>truſting that through Chriſt we are dead to ſin and alive to God, and that our old man is crucified, Rom.</hi> 6.2, 6, 4. and that <hi>we live by the ſpirit, Gal.</hi> 5.25. and that <hi>we have forgiveneſs of ſin;</hi> and <hi>that God is our God, Pſal.</hi> 31.14. and that <hi>we have in the Lord righteouſneſs and ſtrength, whereby we are able to do all things, Iſa.</hi> 45.24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. and that <hi>we ſhall be glortenſly happy in the anjoyment of Chriſt to all eternity, Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. When the Saints in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeak ſo highly of ſuch glorious ſpiritual Privileges as I have here named, they acquaint us with the familiar fence and language of their Faith, truſting on God and Chriſt, and they give us but an Explication of the nature and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96243:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>contents of it; and they ſpeak of nothing more than what they receive out of the Fulneſs of Chriſt. And how can we otherwiſe judge, but that thoſe that have an hearty Love to Chriſt, and can upon a good ground think and ſpeak ſuch high things concerning themſelves, muſt needs be heartily diſpoſed and mightily ſtrengthened for the practice of Holineſs?</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, Becauſe Faith hath ſuch a natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to diſpoſe and ſtrengthen the Soul for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Holineſs, we have cauſe to judge it a meet Inſtrument to accompliſh every part of that Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in an acceptable manner. Thoſe that with a due affection believe ſtedfaſtly on Chriſt, for the free Gift of all his Salvation, may find by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that they are carried forth by that Faith, according to the meaſure of its Strength or Weakneſs, to love God heartily, becauſe God hath loved them; firſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. to praiſe him, to pray unto him in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.26. <hi>John</hi> 16.26, 27. to <hi>be patient with cheerfulneſs under all afflictions, giving thanks to the Father, that hath called them to his heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Col.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>to love all the children of God, out of love to their heavenly Father,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>to walk as Chriſt walked,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. and to give themſelves up to live to Chriſt in all things, as <hi>conſtrained by his love in dying for them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. We have a Cloud of Witneſſes concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent works that were produced by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. And though truſting on Chriſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted ſuch a ſlight and contemptible thing, yet I know no Work of Obedience which it is not able to produce. And note the excellent manner
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96243:42"/>of working by Faith; by it we live and act in all good Works, as People in Chriſt, as raiſed above our ſelves and our natural ſtate, by parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of him and his Salvation; and we do all in his name, and on his account. This is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of that myſterious manner of living to God in Holineſs, which is peculiar to the Chriſtian Religion, wherein we live, and <hi>yet not we, but Chriſt liveth in us, Gal.</hi> 2.20. And who can imagine any other way but this for ſuch a Practice, while Chriſt and his Salvation is known to us only by the Goſpel?</p>
               <p>The explanation that I have made of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Office of true Faith, and of its Aptitude for its Office, is ſufficient to evidence, that it is a moſt holy Faith, as it is called <hi>Jude</hi> 20. and that ſuch a truſting on Chriſt, as I have deſcribed, in its own nature, cannot have any tendency to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, but only to Holineſs; and that it rooteth and groundeth us in Holineſs more than the meer accepting of any terms of Salvation, and conſenting to have Chriſt for our Lord can do, and is more powerful to ſecure an holy Practice, than any of thoſe Reſolutions of Obedience or <hi>reſignating Acts, that ſome would have to be the great conditions of our ſalvation,</hi> which are indeed <hi>no better than hypocritical Acts,</hi> if they be not produc'd by <hi>this Faith.</hi> There is indeed a counterfeit dead Faith, ſuch as wicked men may have, and if that tend to Licentiouſneſs, let not true Faith be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but rather mark the Deſcription of it which I have given, that you may not be deceived with a counterfeit Faith inſtead of it. I ſhall add ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the efficient cauſe of this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96243:42"/>Grace, and of our Union with Chriſt by it, whereby it may appear, that it is not ſo ſlight and eaſie a way of Salvation as ſome may imagine. The Author and Finiſher of our Faith and of our Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt by Faith, is no leſs than the <hi>infinite Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>God and Chriſt himſelf by the Spirit;</hi> for, <hi>by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are all baptized into one body of Chriſt,</hi> and are all made <hi>to drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 12.12, 13. <hi>God granteth us, according to the Riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with all might by his ſpirit, in the inner man, that Chriſt may dwell in our hearts by Faith, Epheſ.</hi> 3.16, 17. If we do but conſider the great effect of Faith, that by it we are raiſed to live above our natural condition, by Chriſt and his Spirit living in us, we cannot rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it ſhould be within the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do any thing that advanceth us ſo high. If God had done no more for us in our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than to reſtore us to our firſt natural Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, yet this could not have been done without putting forth his own Almighty Power to quicken thoſe that are dead in Sin. How much more is this Almighty Power needful to advance us to this wonderful new kind of Frame, wherein we live and act above all the power of Nature, by an higher Principle of Life than was given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, even by Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, living and acting in us? The natural man bringeth forth his Off-ſpring according to his Image, by that natural Power of multiplying, with which God bleſſed him at his firſt Creation; but the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> bringeth forth his Off-ſpring new born, according to his Image only by the Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>As many as receive him, even thoſe that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96243:43"/>believe on his name, are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, Joh.</hi> 1.12, 13. Chriſt took his own Humane Nature into perſonal Union with himſelf, in the Womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt coming upon her, and the power of the Higheſt overſhadowing her, the ſame Power whereby the World was created, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. So He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us into <hi>myſtical Union</hi> and <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> with himſelf, by no leſs than an <hi>Infinite Creating Power, For we are the workmanſhip of God, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. <hi>And if any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p>For the accompliſhing of this great Work of our new Creation in Chriſt, the Spirit of God doth firſt work upon our Hearts by and with the Goſpel, to produce in us the Grace of <hi>Faith;</hi> for, if the Goſpel ſhould come to us in Word only, <hi>and not in Power and in the Holy Ghoſt, Paul</hi> might labour to plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> to water without any ſucceſs, becauſe we cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God; yea, we ſhall account them fooliſhneſs, until the Spirit of God enable us to diſcern them; 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. &amp; 2.14. We ſhall never come to Chriſt by any teaching of Man, except we alſo <hi>hear and learn of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>be drawn to Chriſt by his ſpirit, John</hi> 6.44, 45. And when <hi>Saving Faith</hi> is wrought in us, the ſame Spirit giveth us faſt hold of Chriſt by it: As he openeth the Mouth of Faith to receive Chriſt, ſo he filleth it with Chriſt, or elſe the acting of Faith would be like a Dream of one that thinketh that he eateth and drinketh, and when
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:96243:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>he awaketh he findeth himſelf empty. The ſame Spirit of God did both give that Faith whereby Miracles were wrought, and did work alſo the Miracles by it: So alſo the ſame Spirit of Chriſt doth work Saving Faith in us, and doth anſwer the aim and end of that Faith, by giving us Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fellowſhip with Chriſt by it: So that none of the Glory of this Work belongeth to Faith, but only to Chriſt and his Spirit. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Faith is of ſuch an humble ſelf-denying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it aſcribeth nothing that it receiveth to itſelf, but all to the Grace of God; and therefore God ſaveth us by Faith, that all the Glory may be aſcribed to his Free-Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. If <hi>Adam</hi> had Strength enough in Innocency to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Duty of Faith as well as we, yet it will not follow, that he had Strength enough to raiſe himſelf above his natural ſtate, into Union with Chriſt, becauſe Faith doth not unite us to Chriſt by its own Vertue, but by the Power of the Spirit working by it and with it. Thus we are <hi>firſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and then active</hi> in this great work of myſtical Union; we are <hi>firſt apprehended of Chriſt,</hi> and then we <hi>apprehend Chriſt;</hi> Chriſt entereth firſt into the Soul, to joyn himſelf to it, by giving it the <hi>Spirit of Faith,</hi> and ſo the Soul receiveth Chriſt and his Spirit by their own Power. As the Sun firſt enlighteneth our Eyes, and then we can ſee it by its own light. We may note further, to the Glory of the Grace of God, that this Union is fully accompliſhed by Chriſt, giving the Spirit of Faith to us, even before we act that Faith in the reception of him, becauſe by this Grace or Spirit of Faith the Soul is enclined and diſpoſed
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:96243:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>to an active receiving of Chriſt. And, no doubt, Chriſt is thus united to many Infants, who have the Spirit of Faith, and yet cannot act Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not come to the uſe of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings; but thoſe of riper years, that are joyned paſſively to Chriſt by the Spirit of Faith, will alſo joyn themſelves with him actively, by the Act of Faith, and until they act this Faith, they cannot know or enjoy their Union with Chriſt, and the Comfort of it, or make uſe of it in acting any other Duties of Holineſs acceptably in this Life.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>We cannot attain to the Practice of true Holineſs by any of our Endeavours while we continue in our natural State, and are not Partakers of a new State by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Fellowſhip with Christ through Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>IT it evident all have not that precious Faith, whereby Chriſt dwelleth in our Hearts, yea, the number of thoſe that have it is ſmall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively to the whole World that lieth in Wickedneſs, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19, 20. and many of thoſe that at length attain unto it, do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue without it for ſome conſiderable time. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. And though ſome may have the Spirit of Faith given to them from their Mothers Womb, (as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Luke,</hi> 1.15.44.) yet even in them there is a natural Being by Generation before there can be a Spiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Regeneration, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.46. Hence ariſeth the Conſideration of two States or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Children of Men, in Matters that appertain to God and Godlineſs, the one of which is vaſtly different from the other. Thoſe that have the Happineſs of a New-birth
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:96243:45"/>and Creation in Chriſt by Faith are thereby pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a very excellent State, conſiſting in the Enjoyment of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, for their Juſtification, and of the Spirit of Chriſt to live by, in Holineſs here, and Glory for ever, as hath already appeared. Thoſe that are not in Chriſt by Faith, cannot be in a better State than that which they received together with their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> by being once born and created in him, or than they can attain to by the Power of that Nature, with any ſuch help as God is pleaſed to afford to it. This latter I call a Natural State, becauſe it conſiſteth in ſuch things as we have either received by natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or can attain to by natural Power through Divine Aſſiſtance; as the Scripture call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Man in this State the <hi>natural Man.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The former I call a new State, becauſe we enter into it by a new Birth in Chriſt, and I may call it a Spiritual State, according to the Scripture, becauſe it received from Chriſt the quickening Spirit, and the Natural and Spiritual Man are oppoſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. though ſome call both theſe States Spiritual, becauſe the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Weal or Woe of the Soul or Spirit of Man, is chiefly concerned in them. It is a common Error of thoſe that are in a corrupt natural State that they ſeek to reform their Lives according to the Law, without any thoughts that their State muſt be changed before their Lives can be changed from Sin to Righteouſneſs. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that knew nothing of a new State in Chriſt, were urged by their own Conſciences to practice ſeveral Duties of the Law according to the Knowledge they had by the Light of Nature,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:96243:45"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>Iſrael</hi> according to the Fleſh, had a Zeal of God and Godlineſs, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to practice the written Law, at leaſt in external Performances, while they were Enemies to the Faith of Chriſt, and <hi>Paul</hi> attainted ſo far, that he was blameleſs in theſe external Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of the Righteouſneſs of the Law, while he perſecuted the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. Some are ſo near the Kingdom of God, while they continue in a Natural State, that they are convinced of the Spirituality of the Law, that it bindeth us principally to love God with all our Heart, Soul, Mind and Strength, and to love our Neighbour as our ſelves, and to perform uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Obedience to God, in all our inward Thoughts and Affections, as well as in all our outward Actions, and to do all the Duties that we owe to our Neighbour, out of this hearty Love, <hi>Mark</hi> 12, 33, 34 And they ſtruggle and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with great earneſtneſs to ſubdue their inward Thoughts and Affections, to the Law of God, and to abſtain not only from ſome Sins, but from all known Sins, and to perform every known Duty of the Law, with their whole Heart and Soul as they think, and are ſo active and intent in their devout Practice, that they overwork their natural Strength, and ſo ſervent in their Zeal, that they are ready even to kill their Bodies with Faſtings and other Macerations, that they may kill their ſinful Luſts. They are ſtrongly convinced, that Holineſs is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, and deeply affected with the Terrours of Damnation, and yet they were never ſo much enlightened in the Myſtery of the Goſpel, as to know that a new State in Chriſt is neceſſary to a new Life, therefore they labour
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:96243:46"/>in vain to reform their natural State inſtead of getting above it in Chriſt. And ſome of theſe, when they have miſpent many Years in ſtriving againſt the Stream of their Luſts without any Succeſs, do at laſt fall miſerably into Deſpair of ever attaining to Holineſs, and turn to wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire of their Luſts, or are fearfully ſwallowed up with horrour of Conſcience. There are ſeveral falſe Opinions whereby ſuch igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Zealots encourage themſelves in their fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Endeavours. Some of them judge that they are able to practice Holineſs, becauſe they are not compelled to ſin, and may abſtain from it if they will. To this they add, That Chriſt by the Merit of his Death, hath reſtored that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Will to good, which was loſt by the Fall, and hath ſet Nature upon its Legs again, and that if they endeavour to do what lieth in them, Chriſt will do the reſt, by aſſiſting them with the Supplies of his ſaving Grace; ſo they truſt upon the Grace of Chriſt to help them in their Endeavours. They plead further, That it would not conſiſt with the Juſtice of God to puniſh them for Sin, if they could not avoid it, and that it would be in vain for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel to preach to them, and exhort them to any ſaving Duty, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perform it. They produce Examples of I leathens, and of ſuch as had the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians without any acquaintance with the Faith that I have deſcribed, who have attained to a great Excellency in religious Words and Works.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:96243:46"/>
               <p>My Work at preſent is, to deliver thoſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Zealots from their fruitleſs tormenting La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, by bringing them to deſpair of the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Holineſs in a natural State, that they may ſeek it only in a new State by Faith in Chriſt, where they may certainly find it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch tormenting Labour and Anxiety of Spirit. For this end I ſhall confirm the Truth aſſerted in the Direction, and fortifie it againſt the forementioned falſe Opinions by the enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Foundation of this Aſſertion is firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid in the Directions already explained, and confirmed by many Places of Scripture: For if all Endowments neceſſary to enable us for an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Practice, be to be had only in a State of Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt by Faith, and Faith it ſelf not by the natural Power of Free-will, but by the Power of Chriſt, coming into the Soul by his Spirit, to unite us with himſelf, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that the Attainment of true Holineſs by any of our moſt vigorous Endeavours, while we continue in our natural Condition, is altogether hopeleſs? I need add no more were it not to ſhew more ſully what abundance of Light the Scripture affordeth to guide us aright in this part of our way, that thoſe that wander out of it, by following any falſe light of their own, or others corrupted Judgments, may find themſelves the more inexcuſable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is evident that we cannot practice true Holineſs, while we continue in a natural State, becauſe we muſt be <hi>born again of water and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96243:47"/>of the Spirit,</hi> or elſe <hi>we cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> Joh. 3.3, 5. And we are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them. If we could love God and our Neighbour as the Law requireth, without a New-birth and Creation, we might live without them; for Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>This do and thou ſhalt live,</hi> Luke 10.28. Now a <hi>New-birth</hi> and <hi>Creation,</hi> is more than a meer reforming and repairing our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State. If we were put into a certain State and Condition by the firſt Birth and Greati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much more by the ſecond: For the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the Subſtance of a Man as well as a State, the ſecond hath nothing to produce, but a new State of the ſame Perſon. And note that we were firſt created and born in <hi>Adam</hi> the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Man, but our <hi>New-birth</hi> and <hi>Creation</hi> is in Chriſt the Spiritual Man; and if <hi>any man be in Christ, he is in a new-ſtate,</hi> far different from the State of <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall, he is <hi>wholly a new creature,</hi> as it is written, <hi>old things are past away, behold all things are become new,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is poſitively aſſerted by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8.8. Many are too overly and negligent in conſidering the Senſe of this Goſpel-phraſe what it is to be <hi>in the fleſh.</hi> They underſtand no more by it than to be ſinful, or to be addicted inordinately to pleaſe the ſenſitive Appetite. They ſhould conſider that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh here of <hi>being in the fleſh,</hi> as the cauſe of Sinfulneſs, as in the next <hi>verſe,</hi> he ſpeaketh of <hi>being in the Spirit,</hi> as the cauſe of Holineſs, and whatever cauſe it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96243:47"/>be, it muſt needs be diſtinct from its Effect. Sin is a Property of the Fleſh, or ſomething that dwelleth in the Fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. and therefore it is not the Fleſh it ſelf. The Fleſh is that which <hi>luſteth against the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.17. and therefore it is not meerly ſinful Luſt. The true Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, is, That by <hi>fleſh</hi> is meant the Nature of Man, as it is corrupted by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and propagated from him to us, in that corrupt State by natural Generation, and to <hi>be in the fleſh,</hi> is to be in a Natural State, as to <hi>be in the Spirit,</hi> is to be in a new State, by the <hi>Spirit of Christ dwelling in us,</hi> Rom. 8.9. The corrupt Nature is called <hi>Fleſh,</hi> becauſe it is received by carnal Generation, and the new Nature is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Spirit,</hi> becauſe it is received by Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit,</hi> John 3.6. So the Apoſtle, if he be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, hath ſaid enough to make us deſpair ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of attaining to true Holineſs, while we continue in a Natural Sate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Apoſtle teſtifieth that thoſe that <hi>have been taught as the truth is in Jeſus,</hi> have learned to avoid the former ſinful Converſation, by <hi>putting off the old-man, which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitful luſts,</hi> and <hi>by putting on the new-man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4.21.22, 24. Putting on the Old-man, and putting on the New-man is the ſame thing with not being in the Fleſh, but in the Spirit, in the foregoing Teſtimony, that is putting off our natural State, and putting on a new State, by Union and Fellowſhip with
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96243:48"/>Chriſt. The Apoſtle himſelf ſheweth that by the new Man, is meant that excellent State where <hi>Christ is all and in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. Therefore by the old Man, muſt needs be meant the natural State of Man, wherein he is without the ſaving Enjoyment of Chriſt, which is called <hi>Old,</hi> becauſe of the new State to which Believers are brought by their Regeneration in Chriſt. This is a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Expreſſion peculiar to the Goſpel as well as the former, and as ſlightly conſidered by thoſe that think that the Apoſtles Meaning is only that they ſhould put off Sinfulneſs, and put on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in their Converſation, and ſo they think to become new Men, by turning a new Leaf in their Practice, and leading a new Life. Let them learn here, that the old and new Man, are two contrary States containing in them, not only Sin and Holineſs, but all other things that diſpoſe and incline us to the Practice of them; and that the old Man muſt be put off, as orucified with Chriſt, before we can be freed from the Practice of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6, 7. And therefore we cannot lead a new Life, until we have firſt gotten a new State by Faith in Chriſt. Let me add here, that the meaning of the Apoſtle is the ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12, 13, 14. where he directeth us to <hi>put on the Lord Jeſus Christ, as the means whereby we may cast off the deeds of darkneſs, and walk honestly as in the day time, not fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Our natural State hath <hi>ſeveral Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> that wholly diſable us for the Practice of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and inſlaves us to the Practice of Sin, while we continue in it. Here I ſhall ſhew, that the old Man, the Fleſh, or natural State, is not only Sin
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:96243:48"/>as ſome would have it, but it containeth in it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things which I ſhall name, that make it to be ſinful, beſides ſeveral other things that make it miſerable. I have ſhewed that in Chriſt we have all Endowments neceſſary to frame us for God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; ſo in our fleſhly State we have all things contrary to that holy Frame. One thing belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our natural State, is the Guilt of Sin, even of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin, and of the ſinful Depravation of our Nature, and of all our own actual Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and therefore we are <hi>by nature the children of wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 2.3. Under the Curſe of God, the Benefit of Remiſſion of our Sins and Freedom from Condemnation, is not given to us in the Fleſh, or in a natural State, but only in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. And can we imagine that a Man ſhould be able to prevail againſt Sin, while God is againſt him and curſeth him? <hi>Another Property</hi> inſeparable from the former, <hi>is an evil Conſcience,</hi> which denounceth the Wrath of God againſt us for Sin, and inclineth us to abhor him as our Enemy, rather than to love him, as hath been ſhewed; or if it be a <hi>blind Conſcience,</hi> it hardeneth us the more in our Sins. A <hi>third Property is an evil Inclination</hi> tending only to Sin, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called <hi>Sin that dwelleth in us, and the law of ſin in our members that powerfully ſubdueth and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivateth us to the ſervice of ſin,</hi> Rom, 7.20, 23. It hath a fixed Propenſity to luſt againſt the Law without any Deliberation, and therefore its Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are not to be prevented by any Diligence or Watchfulneſs. The Mind of the Fleſh <hi>is enmity</hi> againſt the Law of God, or it is <hi>not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can it be.</hi> How vain then is it to plead that they can do good if they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96243:49"/>will, when their Minds and Will it ſelf is enſlaved to Sin. A <hi>fourth Property is Subjection to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Devil,</hi> who is <hi>the God of this world, that hath blinded the minds of all that believe not,</hi> 2. Cor. 4.4. And will certainly conquer all that he ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with upon his own Dunghill, that <hi>is in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State.</hi> And from all theſe Properties we may well conclude that it hath the Property never to be good, to be ſtark dead in Sin, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Sentence denounced againſt the firſt Sin of Mankind in <hi>Adam, in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2.17. For you can no more bring it to Holineſs by any the moſt vehement Motives and Endeavours, then you can bring a dead Carcaſe to Life, by chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rubbing it. You can ſtir up no ſtrength or fortifying Grace in the natural Man by ſuch Motives and Endeavours, becauſe there is no Strength in him to be ſtirred up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. Tho' you do all that lieth in you to the utmoſt, while you are in this Fleſh you can do nothing but ſin; for there is no good lying in you, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth by his own Experience, <hi>I know that in me, (that is in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We have no good ground to truſt on Chriſt, <hi>to help us to will or to do that</hi> which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, while we continue in our natural State, or to imagine that Freedom of Will to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, is reſtored to us by the Merit of his Death. For as it hath been already ſhewed, Chriſt aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at an higher end in his Incarnation, Death and Reſurrection, than the reſtoring the Decay and Ruins of our natural State: He aimed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96243:49"/>us to a new State more excellent than the State of Nature ever was, by Union and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with himſelf, that we might live to God, not by the Power of a natural Free-will, but by the Power of his Spirit living and acting in us. So we may conclude, that our natural State is irrecoverable and deſperate, becauſe Chriſt the only Saviour did not aim at the Recovery of it. It is neither holy nor happy, but ſubject to Sin, and to all Miſeries as long as it remaineth. Even thoſe that are in a new State in Chriſt, and do ſerve the Law of God with their Mind, do yet with their Fleſh ſerve the Law of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.25. As far as it remaineth in them it <hi>luſteth against the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 5.17. And <hi>it remaineth dead becauſe of ſin, even when the ſpirit is life to them becauſe of righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 8.10. And muſt be wholly aboliſhed by Death, before we can be perfected in that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Happineſs that is by Faith in Chriſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God had promiſed Salvation by Chriſt, the Seed of the Woman, he placed Cherubims and a flaming Sword to keep Man out of Paradice, thereby teaching. him that his firſt State was loſt without Hope, and that the Happineſs intended for him was wholly new. Our old natural Man was not revived and reformed by the Death of Chriſt, but crucified together with him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be aboliſhed and deſtroyed out of us by virtue of his Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. It is like the part of a Garment infected with the Plague of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, which was to be rent off as incurable, that the Garment might be clean, <hi>Levit.</hi> 13.56. <hi>If Chriſt be not in us we are reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>i. e.</hi> we are in a State which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected from partaking of his Salvation, ſo that we
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96243:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>are not to expect any Aſſiſtance from God to make us holy in it, but rather to deliver us from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> This doth not at all diſcharge thoſe that are in a natural State from Obligation to Holineſs of Life, nor render them excuſable for their Sins, at the Tribunal of God's Juſtice. <hi>For God hath made man upright, but they ſought many inventions,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.29. Obſerve well the Words of this Text, and you will find that all they who have ſought out many Inventions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than upright walking, are comprehended in Man that was at firſt made upright. And Man in the Text ſignifieth all Mankind, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was all Mankind, as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau were two nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the womb of Rebecca,</hi> Gen. 25.23. God made us all in our firſt Parents according to his own Image, able and inclined to do his Law, and in that pure Nature our Obligation to Obedience was firſt laid upon us, and the firſt wilful Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, whereby our firſt Parents bereaved themſelves of the Image of God, and brought upon themſelves the Sentence of Death, was our Sin as well as theirs, <hi>For in one man Adam, all have ſinned, and ſo death is paſſed upon all,</hi> Rom. 5.12. Becauſe all Mankind were in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Loins, when the firſt Sin was committed, even as <hi>Levi</hi> may be ſaid to have paid Tithes in <hi>Abraham</hi> before he was born, becauſe when his Father <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tithes to <hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> he was yet in his Loins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9, 10. That Promiſe of God that he will not charge the Iniquities of Parents upon their Children, is a Promiſe belonging to the New Covenant confirmed in the Blood of Chriſt, and it is Yea and Amen to us only in Chriſt, in whom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96243:50"/>we have another Nature than that which our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents conveyed to us, ſo that we cannot juſtly claim the Benefit of it in our old natural State, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.29, 30, 31. &amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Thoſe that account their Impotency a ſufficient Plea to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them or others, ſhew that they were never truly humbled for that great wilful Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all Mankind in the Loins of <hi>Adam.</hi> Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to pay Debts excuſeth not a Debtor that hath laviſhed away his Eſtate; neither doth Drunkenneſs excuſe the mad Actings of a Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, but rather aggravates his Sin. And our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency conſiſteth not in a meer want of an <hi>exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutive Power,</hi> but in the want of a willing Mind to practice true Holineſs and Righteouſneſs. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we love it not, we like it not, but luſt againſt it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. and <hi>hate the light,</hi> John 3.20. If Men in a natural State had an hearty Love and Likeing to true Holineſs, and a deſire and ſerious endeavour to practice it out of hearty Love, and yet failed in the event, then they might under ſome pretence plead for their Excuſe (as ſome do for them) that they were compelled to ſin by an inevitable Fate. But none have juſt cauſe to plead any ſuch thing for their excuſe, becauſe none endeavour to practice true Holineſs out of hearty Love to it, until the good Work be begun in their Souls, and when God hath begun he will perfect it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. And will in the mean time accept their ready Mind, though they fall ſhort in Performance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. <hi>How abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable then and filthy is man that drinketh up ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity us water,</hi> Job. 15.16. That cannot pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Holineſs, becauſe he will not. This is their juſt Condemnation, <hi>that they love darkneſs rather
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96243:51"/>light.</hi> They deſerve to be Partakers with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels in Torments, as they partake with them in evil Luſts, and their Inability to do Good will no more excuſe them, than it excuſeth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Neither will this Aſſertion make it a vain thing to preach the Goſpel to natural Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to exhort them to true Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, for their Converſion and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the Deſign of our Preaching is not to bring them to Holineſs in their natural State, but to raiſe them above it, and to preſent them <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Christ,</hi> in the Performance of thoſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. And though they cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe Duties by their natural Strength, yet the Goſpel is made effectual for their Converſion and Salvation, by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, which accompanieth the Preaching of it, to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en thoſe that are dead in Sin, and to create them a new in Chriſt, by giving to them Repentance unto Life, and a lively Faith in Chriſt. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel cometh to the Elect of God, not <hi>only in word, but alſo in power and in the Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>in ſuch Aſſurance,</hi> that they receive <hi>it with joy of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>The Goſpel is the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit that giveth life,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.6, 8. <hi>It is mighty through God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4. It depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not at all upon the Power of our Free-will to make it ſucceſsful for our Converſion; but it conveyeth into the Soul that Life and Power, whereby they receive and obey it, Chriſt can make thoſe that are dead in Sin <hi>to hear his voice and live,</hi> John 5.25. Therefore he can ſpeak to them by his Goſpel, and Command them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96243:51"/>and believe with good Succeſs, as well as he could ſay to dead Carcaſes, <hi>Tabitha cumi,</hi> Mark 5.41. <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi> John 11, 43, 44. And to the Sick of the Palſie, <hi>Ariſe, take up thy bed and go unto thine houſe,</hi> Matth. 9.6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> There is no reaſon that the Examples of Heathen Philoſophers or any <hi>Jews</hi> or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by outward Profeſſion, that have lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſaving Knowledge of God in Chriſt, ſhould move us by their wiſe Sayings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouned Attainments in the Practice of Devotion and Morality, to recede from this Truth that hath been ſo fully confirmed out of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Have we not cauſe to judge that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> while he was a zealous Phariſee, and at leaſt ſome few of the great. Multitude of the <hi>Jews</hi> in his time, that were zealous of the Law, and had the Inſtruction of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, attained as near to that true Holineſs, as the Heathen Philoſophers, or any others in their natural State. Yet <hi>Paul,</hi> after he was enlightned with the ſaving Knowledge of Chriſt, judged himſelf the <hi>chief of ſinners,</hi> in his higheſt former Attainments, though in the Judgment of others he was blameleſs touching the Righteouſneſs which is in the Law, and he found it neceſſary to begin to live to God in a new way by Faith in Chriſt, and to ſuffer the <hi>loſs of all</hi> his former Attainments, <hi>and to count them but dung that he might win Chriſt,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. Phil. 3.6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>And none of the great Multitude of <hi>Jews</hi> that followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs did ever attain unto it, <hi>while they ſought it not by faith
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96243:52"/>in Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32. What Performances are greater in outward Appearance than for a Man <hi>to give all his goods to the poor, and to give his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be burnt,</hi> and yet the Scripture alloweth us to ſuppoſe that this may be done without <hi>true Charity,</hi> and therefore without any <hi>true holineſs of the heart and life,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3. Men in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State may have ſtrong Convictions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power, Wiſdom, Juſtice and Goodneſs of God, and of the Judgment to come, and the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Happineſs of the Godly, and Torments of the Wicked; and theſe Convictions may ſtir them up, not only to make an high Profeſſion, and to utter rare Sayings concerning God and Godlineſs, but alſo to labour with great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to avoid all known Sin, to ſubdue their Luſts, to perform univerſal Obedience to God in all known Duties, and to ſerve him with their Lives and Eſtates to the utmoſt, and to extort out of their Hearts ſome kind of Love to God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that if poſſible they may eſcape the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Torments of Hell, and procure everlaſting Happineſs by their Endeavours. Yet all their Love to God is but forced and feigned, they have no hearty liking to God or his Service, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him an hard Maſter, and his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grievous, and they repine and fret inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the burden of them, and were it not for fear of everlaſting Fire, they would little regard the Enjoyment of God in Heaven, and they would be glad if they might have the Liberty to enjoy their Luſts without danger of Damnation. The higheſt Preferment of thoſe that are born only after the Fleſh in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, is but to <hi>be children of the bond-woman,</hi> Gal. 4.23. And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96243:52"/>though they do more in God's Service than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his dear Children, yet God accepteth not their Service, becauſe their beſt Performances are ſlaviſh without any Child-like Affections towards God, and no better than gliſtering Sins, and yet theſe natural Men are not at all beholden to the goodneſs of their Natures for theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Shews of Holineſs, or for the leaſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from the groſſeſt Sin. If God ſhould leave Men fully to their own natural Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and to the Power of Satan (as they deſerve) all Shew of Religion and Morality would be quickly baniſhed out of the World, and we ſhould grow paſt feeling in Wickedneſs, and like to the <hi>Canibals,</hi> who are as good by Nature as our ſelves. But God that can reſtrain the Burning of the ſiery Furnace without quenching it, and the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Water without changing its nature, doth alſo reſtrain the working of natural Corruption without mortifying it, and through the greatneſs of his Wiſdom and Power, he <hi>maketh his enemies to yield feigned obedience to him,</hi> Pſal. 66.3. And to do many things good for the matter of them, though they can do nothing in a right holy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He hath appointed ſeveral means to reſtrain our Corruptions as the Law, Terrors of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, terrible Judgments, and Rewards in this Life, Magiſtrates, humane Laws, Labour for Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, Food and Raiment, and thoſe Goſpel means, that are effectual for Sanctification, ſerve alſo for Reſtraint of Sin. God hath gracious ends in this Reſtraint of Sin, that his Church may be preſerved, and his Goſpel preached in the World, and that theſe Natural Men may be in a better Capacity to receive the Inſtruction
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96243:53"/>of the Goſpel, and that ſuch of them that are choſen, may in due time be converted, and that thoſe of them that are not truly converted may enjoy more of the Goodneſs of God here, and ſuffer the leſs Torments hereafter. As vile and wicked as the World is, we have cauſe to praiſe and to magnifie the Free Goodneſs of God that it is no worſe.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>FOR the underſtanding the terms of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, note here, that I take Salvation as comprehending Juſtification, as well as other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Benefits, and ſincere Obedience, as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending holy Reſolutions, as well as the fulfilling of them. The worſt of Men that have any Senſe of Religion are prone to imagine, that the ſure way to eſtabliſh the Practice of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> is to make it the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Condition of the Favour of <hi>God,</hi> and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96243:54"/>all Happineſs. This may appear by the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous falſe Religions that have prevailed moſt in the World. In this way the Heathens were brought to their beſt Devotion and Morality, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Judgment of God, that thoſe that violate ſeveral of the great Duties to God and their Neighbour are worthy of Death; and by their Conſciences accuſing or excuſing them, according to the Practiſe of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. &amp; 2.14, 15. Our Conſciences are informed by the common Light of Natural Reaſon, that it is juſt with God to require us to perform theſe Duties, that we may avoid his Wrath, and enjoy his Favour; and we cannot find any better way than this, to obtain Happineſs, or to ſtir up our ſelves to Duty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine Revelation. Yet becauſe our own Conſciences teſtifie, that we often fail in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of theſe Duties, we are enclined by Self-Love to perſwade our ſelves, that our ſincere Endeavours to do the beſt we can, ſhall be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to procure the Favour of God, and Pardon for all our <hi>Failings.</hi> Thus we ſee, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Salvation, by the Condition of ſincere Obedience, hath its original from our corrupt Natural Reaſon, and is part of the Wiſdom of this World; it is none of the Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, that hidden Wiſdom, God ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World to our Glory; it is none of thoſe things of the Spirit of God, which have not entred into the Heart of Man, and which the Natural man cannot receive, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him, neither can he know them, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6, 7, 9, 14. It is none of the fooliſhneſs of Preaching, whereby it pleaſed God to ſave them that believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:96243:54"/>10.21. And though we have a better way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us in the Goſpel, for the enjoyment of the Favour of God, and Holineſs it ſelf, and all Salvation, without any procuring Condition of Works, by the free Gift of God's Grace through Faith in Chriſt; yet it is very difficult to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men out of a way that they are naturally addicted to, and that hath foreſtalled and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated their Judgments, and is bred in their Bone, and therefore cannot eaſily be gotten out of the Fleſh. Moſt of thoſe that live under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and profeſſion of the Goſpel, are not brought to hate Sin as Sin, and to love Godlineſs for itſelf, though they be convinced of the neceſſity of it to Salvation, and therefore they cannot love it heartily. The only means that they can take to bring themſelves to it, is to ſtir up themſelves to an Hypocritical Practice in their old natural way, that they may avoid Hell and get Heaven by their Works. And their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences witneſs, that the Zeal and Love that they have for God and Godlineſs, their Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, Sorrow for Sin, ſtrictneſs of Life, are in a manner forced and extorted from them by ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh Fear and mercenary Hope; ſo that they are afraid, that if they ſhould truſt on Chriſt, for Salvation by Free-Grace without Works, the fire of their Zeal and Devotion would be quickly extinguiſhed, and they ſhould grow careleſs in Religion, and let looſe the Reins to their Luſts, and bring certain Damnation upon themſelves. This moveth them to account them the only <hi>Boanerges</hi> and powerful Preachers that preach lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or none of the Doctrine of Free-Grace, but rather ſpend their Pains in rebuking Sin and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96243:55"/>People to get Chriſt and his Salvation by their Works, and thundering Hell and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Sinners. It hath been farther obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſome that have contended much for Salvation by Free-Grace, without any Condition of Works, have fallen into <hi>Antinomian</hi> Opinions and licentious Practices. The Experience of theſe things hath much prevailed with ſome learned and zealous men of late amongſt our ſelves, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, without Works, formerly profeſſed unanimouſly, and ſtrongly defended by the Proteſtants, againſt the Papiſts, as a principal Article of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. They have perſwaded themſelves, that ſuch a way of Juſtification is ineffectual, yea, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to Sanctification, and that the practice of ſincere Obedience cannot be eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Antinomian</hi> Dotages and prevailing Luſts, except it be made the neceſſary Condition of our Juſtification, and ſo of our eternal Salvation. Therefore they conclude, that God hath certainly made ſincere Obedience to be the Condition of our Salvation. And they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to new-model the Proteſtant Doctrine, and to interpret the holy Scriptures in a way agreeable and ſubſervient to this their only ſure Foundation of Holineſs.</p>
               <p>But I hope to ſhew, that this their imagined ſure Foundation of Holineſs was never laid by the Holy God, but that it is rather an Errour in the Foundation, pernicious to the true Faith, and to Holineſs of Life. I account it an Error eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be abhorred and deteſted, becauſe we are ſo prone to be ſeduced by it, and becauſe it is an Error whereby Satan transforming himſelf into an
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96243:55"/>Angel of Light, and a Patron of Holineſs, hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withſtood the Goſpel in the Apoſtles times, and ſtirred up men to perſecute it, out of zeal for the Law, and hath ſince prevailed to ſet up and maintain Popery, whereby the Myſtery of Iniquity worketh apace in theſe days, to corrupt the Purity of the Goſpel amongſt the Proteſtants, and to heal the deadly wound that was given to Popery by preaching the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith without Works.</p>
               <p>One thing aſſerted in the Direction againſt this fundamental Error, is, that it is a way of Salvation by the Works of the Law, and not by the Faith of Chriſt, as revealed in the Goſpel. Though the maintainers of it would have us believe, that it is the only way of the Goſpel, that ſo we may not doubt of its Power and Efficacy for our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Sanctification, and our whole Salvation. Their Reaſons are, becauſe the Law, as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, requireth us to do all its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments perfectly, that we may live; whereas they plead only for a milder Condition of ſincere doing, that we may live. And they plead not for doing of Duties, as obliged thereunto by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Law given of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in obedience to the Commands of Chriſt in the Goſpel. Neither do <hi>they</hi> plead for Salvation by ſincere Obedience without Chriſt, but only by Chriſt, and through his Merit and Righteouſneſs; and they acknowledge, that both Salvation itſelf and ſincere Obedience, are given to them freely, by the Grace of Chriſt, ſo that all is of Grace. They acknowledge alſo, that their Salvation is by Faith, becauſe ſincere Obedience is wrought in them by believing the Goſpel, and is included in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96243:56"/>he nature of that Faith, which is the entire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Salvation: And ſome call it the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignating Act of Faith; but all theſe Reaſons are but a fallacious Vizard upon a legal way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to make it look like pure Goſpel; as I ſhall evince by the following particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> All that ſeek Salvation by the ſincere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of good Works, as the procuring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, are condemned by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> for ſeeking Righteouſneſs by the Works of the Law, and not by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. and for ſeeking to be juſtified by the Law, and falling from the Grace of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. This <hi>one Aſſertion,</hi> if it can be proved, is enough to pluck off the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Vizard from the Condition of ſincere Obedience, and to make men abhor it as a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning legal Doctrine, that bereaveth its Followers of all Salvation by Chriſt. And the proof of it is not difficult to perſons that warily conſider a point of ſo great moment for their Salvation. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> againſt whom the Apoſtle chiefly diſputeth in this whole Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, did not profeſs any hope of being juſtified by perfect Obedience, according to the rigour of the Law, but only by ſuch Obedience as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be ſincere, and not hypocritical. And we have no cauſe to doubt, but that the Judaizing <hi>Galatians</hi> had learned by the Goſpel to diſtinguiſh ſincere Obedience from Hypocriſie. The Jewiſh Religion bound all that profeſſed it, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves to be Sinners, as appeareth by their anniverſary Humiliation at the day of atonement, and ſeveral other Rights of the Law, and many clear Teſtimonies in the Oracles of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:96243:56"/>God, that were committed to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.20. Yet they knew they were bound to turn to the Lord with all their Hearts, in Sincerity and Uprightneſs, and that God would accept of ſincere Obedience, for which Cauſe they might better put it for the Condition of the Law, than we can of the Goſpel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6, 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.10. So that if the Apoſtle had diſputed againſt thoſe that held only perfect Obedience to be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Juſtification, he had contended with his own ſhadow. And they might as readily judge ſincere obedience to <hi>be</hi> the condition of Juſtification under the Law, as we can judge it to be the condition under the Goſpel. Neither doth the Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them meerly for accounting ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> to be the Condition of their Juſtification, but more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for ſeeking Salvation by their own Works. And he alledgeth againſt them, That <hi>Abrabam,</hi> who lived before the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by any of his Works, though he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſincere Obedience; and that <hi>David,</hi> who lived under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not juſtified by his Works, though he performed ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and was as much bound to obey the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we are to obey any Commands of Chriſt in the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2, 3, 5, 6. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he condemn them for ſeeking their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation only by Works, without reſpecting at all the Grace and Salvation that is by Chriſt; for the Judaizing <hi>Galatians</hi> were yet Profeſſors of the Grace and Salvation of Chriſt, though they thought Obedience to the Law a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the partaking of it, as alſo many other
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:96243:57"/>Judaiſing Believers did: And doubtleſs they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted themſelves obliged thereunto, not only by the Authority of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of Chriſt alſo, whom they owned as their Lord and Saviour. And we may be ſure it was no damning Error, to account <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law obliging at that time, for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were ſound Believers, held the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be in force at that time, and <hi>Paul</hi> was tender towards them in it, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20, 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.5. And other <hi>Jews</hi> ſought Juſtification not only by their ſincere Works, but alſo by truſting on the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and on their Prieſthood and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were Types of Chriſt. And the moſt legal <hi>Phariſees</hi> would thank God for their good Works, as proceeding from his Grace, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. And they could as well acknowledge their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be by Faith, as the Aſſertors of Salvation by ſincere Obedience can in theſe days; for they accounted, that their ſincere Obedience was wrought in them by believing the Word of God, which contained Goſpel as well as legal Doctrin in it; and therefore that it muſt be included in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Faith, if Faith were taken for the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their whole Salvation. Let the Aſſertors of the Condition of ſincere Obedience learn from hence, that they are building again that Judaiſm which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſtroyed, whereby the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32. And the <hi>Galatians</hi> were in danger of falling from Chriſt and Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 4. And let them beware of falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Curſe which he hath denounced on this very occaſion, againſt any Man or Angel, that ſhall preach any other Goſpel than that which he hath preached, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:96243:57"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The difference betwixt the Law and Goſpel doth not at all conſiſt in this, that the one requireth perfect doing, the other only ſincere do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but in this, that the one requireth doing, the other no doing, but believing for Life and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their terms are different not only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but in their whole nature.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> oppoſeth the Believing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Goſpel to all doing for Life, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition proper to the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. The Law is not of Faith, but the man that doth them ſhall live in them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his Faith is counted for righteouſneſs.</hi> If we ſeek Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by never ſo eaſie and mild a Condition of Works, we do thereby bring our ſelves under the Terms of the Law, and do become Debtors to fulfill the whole Law in perfection, though we intended to engage our ſelves only to fulſill it in part, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. for the Law is a compleat Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the only Terms whereby God will judge all that are not brought to deſpair of procuring Salvation by any of their own Works, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as a <hi>Gift</hi> freely given to them by the <hi>Grace of God in Chriſt.</hi> So that all that ſeek Salvation right or wrong, knowingly or ignorantly, by any works, leſs or more, whether invented by their own Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or commanded of God in the Old or New Teſtament, ſhall at laſt ſtand or fall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thoſe Terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sincere Obedience cannot be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to all the Commands of Chriſt in the Goſpel, except it be alſo performed to the Moral Law, as given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as obliging us by that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Some Aſſertors of the Condition of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96243:58"/>by ſincere Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt, would fain be free from the authority of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe that juſtifieth none, but thundereth out a Curſe againſt all thoſe that ſeek Salvation by the Works of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 11. But if they were at all juſtified by ſincere Works, their reſpect to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Authority would not hinder their Succeſs, for many that were good Chriſtians ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted themſelves bound to obey not only the moral but the ceremonial Law; and if they had ſought Juſtification by any Works, they would have ſought it by thoſe <hi>Acts</hi> 20: 20, 21. They knew not of any Juſtification by ſincere Works, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded only in the Goſpel; yet if they had erred in any thing abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, the Apoſtles would not have tolerated their weakneſs. And whether they will or no, they muſt ſeek their Salvation by the Works of the moral Law, as gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or elſe they can never get it by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience to the Commands of Chriſt, Chriſt never loved their new Condition ſo well, as to aboliſh the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the moral Law, for the eſtabliſhment of it; he came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfill them in the Practice required by them, and hath declared, that thoſe that break one of the leaſt of theſe Commandments, and teach men ſo, <hi>ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven: but whoſoever ſhall do and teach them, the ſame ſhall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 5.17, 19. He commandeth us, to <hi>do to men whatſoever we would they ſhould do to us,</hi> becauſe <hi>this is the Law and the Prophets;</hi> which is ſufficient to prove, that He would have us to account the Law authoritative to oblige us in this matter. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96243:58"/>his Diſciples to obſerve and do whatſoever the Scribes and Phariſees bid them, becauſe they ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Seat, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23.</p>
               <p>And to come to the point in hand, when Chriſt had occaſion to anſwer the Queſtions of thoſe that were guilty of the ſame Error that I am now dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with, in ſeeking their Salvation by their own Works, He ſhewed them, that they muſt obey the Commands as they were already eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Authority in the Scripture of the Old Teſtament. <hi>What is written in the Law? how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou? This do, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> Luke 10.26. <hi>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments,</hi> which are, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murder, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner the Apoſtles of Chriſt urged the performance of moral Duties upon Believers, by the authority of the Law given by <hi>Moſes.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth <hi>to love one another,</hi> becauſe He that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8. and to <hi>honour</hi> our <hi>Father and Mother,</hi> which is the firſt Commandment with Promiſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.2. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> exhorteth to love others as no new, but an old Commandment. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>James</hi> exhorteth to <hi>fulfill the royal law accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> and to keep all the Commands of the Law, one as well as another, becauſe He that ſaid, <hi>Do not commit Adultery,</hi> ſaid alſo <hi>Do not kill, Jam.</hi> 2.8, 10, 11. Sound Proteſtants have accounted the denial of the Authority of the moral Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be an <hi>Antinomian</hi> Error; tho' our late Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators againſt <hi>Antinomianiſm</hi> maintain this Error, yet they eſtabliſh a worſe Error of Juſtification by their ſincere Goſpel-works. I think the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:96243:59"/>of the <hi>Antinomians</hi> aroſe from this Error. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> had its Authority at firſt from Chriſt, for Chriſt was the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ordained the Law by Angels on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> a Mediator for the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who were then his only Church, and with whom we believing Gentiles are now joyned, as fellow-Members of one and the ſame Body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.6. And though Chriſt hath ſince abrogated ſome of the Commandments then given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning figurative Ceremonies and judicial Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, yet he hath not anulled the obligative Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the moral Law, but hath left it in its full force, to oblige us in moral Duties, that are ſtill to be practiſed; as, when ſome Acts of any Parliament are repealed, the Authority of the ſame Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remaineth inviolable in other Acts that are not repealed. I know they object, that the Ten Commandments of the Moral Law, the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Death, written and engraven on Stones, are alſo done away by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. but this maketh altogether againſt their Conditional Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, for they are the miniſtration of Death, and done not as they commanded perfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for even Chriſt himſelf commandeth us to be perfect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.48. but as they were Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for procuring Life and avoiding Death, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by promiſe of Life to the Doers, and a Curſe to the Breakers of them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 12. The Covenant made with <hi>Iſrael</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> is aboliſhed by Chriſt the Mediator of the new Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.8, 9, 13. And the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments bind us not as they were words of that Covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28. I mean, they bind us not as Conditions of that Covenant, except we ſeek
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96243:59"/>to be juſtified by Works; for the Law, as a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, doth ſtill ſtand in force enough to curſe thoſe that ſeek Salvation by their own Works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and if aboliſhed, it is only to thoſe that are in Chriſt by Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19, 20. &amp; 15.15. But the Ten Commandments bind us ſtill, as they were then given to a People that were at that time under the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſhew them what Duties are holy, juſt, and good, well pleaſing to God, and to be a Rule for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. The reſult of all is, that we muſt ſtill practiſe moral Duties, as commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but we muſt not ſeek to be juſtified by our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. If we uſe them as a Rule of Life, not as Conditions of Juſtification, they can be no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Death, or killing Letter unto us; their Perfection indeed maketh them to be harder Terms to procure Life by, but a better Rule to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all Imperfections, and to guide us to that Perfection which we ſhould aim at. And it will be our Wiſdom not to part with the Authority of the Decalogue of <hi>Moſes,</hi> until our new Divines can furniſh us with another Syſtem of Morality as compleat as that, and as excellently compoſed and ordered by the Wiſdom of God, and more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick than that is.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly, Thoſe that endeavour to procure Chriſt's Salvation by their ſincere Obedience to all the Commands of Chriſt, do act contrary to that way of Salvation by Chriſt's Free-grace, and Faith diſcovered in the Goſpel, though they own it in Profeſſion never ſo highly. They act contrary to the way of Salvation by Chriſt, for they would heal themſelves, and ſave themſelves from the Power and Pollution of Sin, and prooure God's
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96243:60"/>Favour by performing ſincere Obedience before they are come to Chriſt the only Phyſician and Saviour. They lay their own Obedience loweſt in the Foundation of their Salvation, and build the Enjoyment of Chriſt upon it, who ought to be the only Foundation. They would ſanctifie themſelves before they have a ſure Intereſt in Chriſt, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, they do not ſubmit themſelves to the Righteouſneſs of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3,4. Sometimes they will call the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, their Legal Righteouſneſs, that they may make room for an Evangelical Righteouſneſs of their own Works, to be the immediate procuring cauſe of their Juſtification by Chriſt, whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> knew no Evangelical Righteouſneſs, but that of Chriſt, which he calleth <hi>the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of faith without the law,</hi> Rom. 3.21, 22. <hi>and not of the law,</hi> Phil. 3.9. Thus they make void Chriſt's Salvation, while they pretend to own it, and Chriſt profiteth them nothing, <hi>Christ is become of none effect</hi> to them, while they would <hi>be juſtified by the Law,</hi> Gal. 5.2, 4. If we would be ſaved by Chriſt, we muſt own our ſelves dead, loſt Sinners, that can have no Righteouſneſs for Juſtification but his, no life or ability to do Good until God bring us to Union and Fellowſhip with him. They do alſo act contrary to Salvation by Grace, according to the true meaning of the Goſpel. For we are not ſaved by Grace, as the ſupreme Cauſe of Salvation by the Interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Works given and accepted by Grace as the procuring Cauſe, in which ſence we might be ſaved by Grace, though by a Covenant of Works. As a Servant that hath Monies given him by his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96243:60"/>Maſter to purchaſe an Annuity of his Maſter at a low rate, may profeſs that he had an Annuity, given him freely, and yet that he hath purchaſed it and may claim it as a due Debt. But we are ſaved by Grace, as the immediate and complete cauſe of our whole Salvation, excluding procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Salvation by the condition of Works and claiming it by any Law as a due Debt. The Scripture teacheth us, that there is a perfect Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and utter Irreconcileableneſs betwixt Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Grace and Works: <hi>If by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace; but if it be of works, then it is no more of grace, otherwiſe work is no more work,</hi> Rom. 11.6. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there is an Oppoſition betwixt a <hi>Reward reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of grace,</hi> and <hi>of debt,</hi> Rom. 4.4. Betwixt a Promiſe of Happineſs <hi>by the law and by grace,</hi> Rom. 4.13.16. God is ſo jealous of the Glory of his Free-grace, that he will not ſave us by any Works though of his own working in us, <hi>leſt any man ſhould boaſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.9. He knoweth that when he healeth Men by Phyſick or maintaineth them by the Labour of their hands, they are prone to attribute the Glory, rather to the means they uſe, than to his ſole Bounty and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, They do alſo act contrary to the way of Salvation by Faith: For, as I have ſhewed already, the Faith which is required for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the Goſpel is to be underſtood in a ſenſe contrary to doing good Works, as a Condition to procure our Salvation, that ſo the true differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the Terms of the Law and of the Goſpel may be maintain'd. Believing is oppoſed to all working for Salvation, and the Law of Works to the Law of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, &amp; 3.27. <gap reason="missing" extent="4 pages">

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:96243:61"/>againſt <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errours, by making it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Condition of their Salvation, when after all this ado, the Remedy is found to be as bad as the Diſeaſe, equally unſerviceable and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to that great end for which they deſigned it, and that it hath an <hi>Antimonian</hi> Effect and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contrary to the Power of Godlineſs. Much more might be ſaid for the Confutation of this novel Doctrine, but if this one thing be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it may be ſufficient to make the zealous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers of it to be aſhamed of their Craſt, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with themſelves, and ſorry that they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſo much Pains and ſtretched their Wits to maintain ſuch an unprofitable unſanctifying Opinion. It will be ſufficient for the Proof of it, if I ſhew, that the practice of true holineſs cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be attain'd unto by ſeeking to be ſaved by the Works of the Law, becauſe I have already proved that this Doctrine of Salvation by ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is according to the Terms of the Law, and not of the Goſpel. And hereby thoſe alſo may ſee their Errour that aſcribe Juſtification only to the Goſpel, and Sanctification to the Law. Yet becauſe thoſe Aſſertors of the Condition of ſincere Obedience, will hardly be perſwaded by what hath been ſaid, that it is the way of the Law of Works. I ſhall for their more full Conviction ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſt, that it is of no other nature and operation than any other Doctrine that is proper to the Law, and hath no better Fruit, as I proceed to prove by the following Arguments, that holineſs cannot be attained by ſeeking it by the Law of Works, that ſo it may appear not worthy to be called Goſpel Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The way of Salvation by the Works of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96243:61"/>the Law is contrary and deſtructive to thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means of an holy Practice, that have been laid down in the foregoing Directions, and manifeſtly proved out of the holy Scripture. I have made it appear, that a hearty Propenſity to an holy Practice cannot be attained without ſome good Perſwaſion of our Reconciliation with God by Juſtification, and of our everlaſting Happineſs, and of ſufficient ſtrength both to will and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our Duty; and that theſe, and all other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments neceſſary to the ſame end, are to be had only in Chriſt, by Union and Fellowſhip with him, and that Chriſt himſelf with all his Fulneſs is united to us by Faith, which is not a Condition to procure a Right or Title to Chriſt, but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument whereby we receive him actually into our Hearts by truſting on him for all Salvation freely promiſed to us in the Goſpel. All theſe means of an holy Practice are things wherein our ſpiritual Life and Happineſs doth conſiſt, ſo that if we have them, everlaſting Life is begun in us already, and becauſe they are the neceſſary means of an holy Practice, therefore the beginning of everlaſting Life in us, muſt not be placed after ſuch a Practice, as the fruit and conſequent of it, but muſt go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, as the Cauſe before the Effect. Now the Terms of the Law are directly contrary to this Method; they place the Practice of Holineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Life, and make it to be the means and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing cauſe of Life, as <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>The man that doeth theſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> By theſe Terms you are firſt to do the holy Duties commanded before you have any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Life promiſed, or any Right to lay hold of it as yours by Faith, and you muſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96243:62"/>Holineſs without the forementioned means, or elſe you can never attain to them. Thus the true means are turned out of their Office, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being Cauſes, they are made to be Effects and Fruits of an holy Practice. And it will be in vain ever to expect ſuch Effects and Fruits; for Holineſs it ſelf with all its Effects muſt needs be deſtroyed when its neceſſary Cauſes are taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, that the <hi>way of ſalvation by the works of the law maketh faith void, and promiſes of none effect. And fruſtrateth the grace of God, as if Christ died in vain, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Christ to be of no profit and of none effect to us, as thoſe that are fallen from grace,</hi> Rom. 4.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. &amp; 5.2, 4. Let us now examine the modern Doctrine of Salvation by the Condition of ſincere Obedience to all the Commands of Chriſt, and we ſhall quickly find it to be a chip of the ſame block, with the former legal way of Salvation in the ſame manner deſtructive to the means of Holineſs, and to Holineſs it ſelf. It requireth of us the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of ſincere Obedience before we have the means neceſſary to produce it, by making it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to our Juſtification and Perſwaſion of eternal Happineſs, and our actual Enjoyment of Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt and of that new Nature, which is to be had only in him by Faith. It deſtroyeth the nature of that ſaving Faith whereby we actually receive and enjoy Chriſt and all his Benefits, and knocketh off our Hands from laying hold of Chriſt and his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by telling us ſtill, as Chriſt told the Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker after all his Labour, that yet we lack ſomething, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.21. That it is Preſumption to take him as our own until we have performed
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:96243:62"/>the Condition for our Right and Title to him, which is another kind of ſaving Faith, otherwiſe called ſincere Obedience. By this deviſed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faith Satan keepeth many poor Souls at a bay poreing upon their own Hearts for many years together, to find whether they have performed the Condition, and whether they have as yet any Right to Chriſt for their Salvation, not daring to venture to take him as their own. It is a ſtrong Partition-wall that will certainly hinder the Soul from coming to Chriſt, until it be thrown down by the Knowledge of Salvation by grace, without any procuring Condition of Works. And though it be accounted but as the Payment of a Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn for a great Eſtate, yet it is enough to break the ableſt Man in the World, becauſe it debarreth him from laying hold of the only effectual means of Holineſs, whereby that Pepper-corn may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, Thoſe that ſeek Salvation by the Works of the Law, do therein act according to their natural State, they live and walk according to the Fleſh, or Old-man, not according to the New-ſtate by Chriſt living in them. I doubt not but ſeveral of them that live under the light of the Goſpel are Partakers of a new State in Chriſt, and do walk holily in it; but the beſt in this World have in them Fleſh as well as Spirit, and may act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to either State in ſome meaſure, and in this matter they do act only according to their carnal natural State. When the believing <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were ſeduced to a Legal way of Salvation, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth it upon them as their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>that having begun in the ſpirit, they would now be made perfect in the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 3.3. And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:96243:63"/>thoſe that deſire to be under the Law, <hi>to Abraham</hi>'s Son born of <hi>Hagar</hi> the Bondwoman, to ſhew that ſuch do walk as thoſe that <hi>are born after the fleſh not after the ſpirit,</hi> Gal. 4.19, 23, 29. The Law was firſt given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State to preſcribe Terms for his continuance in Happineſs which he then enjoyed, and ever ſince that time, the Fleſh or Natural-man is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Law, and the Law hath Dominion over a Man as long as he liveth, <hi>i. e.</hi> until he be dead to his fleſhly State by the Body of Chriſt, and married to him <hi>that is riſen from the dead,</hi> Rom. 7.1, 4. We are not at all under the Law as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works according to our new State in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Ye are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If ye be led by the ſpirit ye are not under the law.</hi> From hence we may firmly conclude that none can poſſibly attain to true Godlineſs by acting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Legal-terms, becauſe I have fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved already, that it is impoſſible to be godly while we are in the fleſh or in a natural State, and that as far as we act according to it, we can do nothing but ſin. The Law is weak through the Fleſh, that it cannot bring us to fulfil its own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3, 4. It is married to a croſs piece of fleſh that is Enmity to it, and can never be ſubject to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. It ſueth the Natural-man for an old Debt of Obedience that he is utterly unable to pay, ſince the Fall and the Succeſs is according to the Proverb, <hi>Sue a beggar and catch a louſe.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do thoſe take a better Courſe that would bring themſelves to Holineſs by making ſincere Obedience to Chriſt's Commands, the Condition of their Salvation. Their way is the ſame for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:96243:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>with that of the <hi>Calatians</hi> before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who would be made perfect in the Fleſh, not by perfect Obedience, but ſincere, as hath been ſhewed before. Their Eudeavours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an Intereſt in Chriſt by their ſincere Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, do teſtifie againſt themſelves, that they do not act as People that are in Chriſt, but rather as People that judge themſelves to be without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and to be yet to ſeek for it. And ſincere Obedience is as impoſſible to be attained unto as perfect Obedience, if we act according to our dead natural State.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, As the Law bereaveth of all ſtrengthning means, that are to be had by Faith in Chriſt, and findeth us without ſtrength in our natural State; ſo of it ſelf it affordeth us no Strength to fulfil its own Commandments. <hi>If there had been a law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the law,</hi> Gal. 3.21. It doth not ſo much as promiſe us life until we have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Obedience required by it, <hi>The man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them,</hi> Rom. 6.5. It is well called a <hi>voice of words,</hi> Heb. 12.19. becauſe its high and big words are not acompanied with any enlivening Power; and the Doctrine of Life and Salvation by ſincere Obedience is not better natur'd or more bountiful to us: For it exacteth of us the Performance of the Condition, before it alloweth us any Life or Salvation by Chriſt. Can any Man rationally expect ſtrength to obey ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, by following a Doctrine that doth not ſo much as promiſe it. The true Goſpel is of a more benign Nature, <hi>For it promiſeth that God would pour out of his ſpirit upon all fleſh,</hi> Acts 2.17. <hi>And will put his law in our mind, and write them in our bearts,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:96243:64"/>Heb.</hi> 8.10. And <hi>will cauſe us to walk in his ſtatutes that we ſhall keep his judgments, and do them,</hi> Ezeck. 36.27. This word of God's Grace, that requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not Holineſs of us as a Condition, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth it to us as a Free-gift, muſt needs be the only Doctrine <hi>that is able to build us up, and to give us an inheritance amongst them that are ſanctified,</hi> Acts 20.32. Seeing it pleaſeth God to bring us to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs by believing a Doctrine we may reaſonably expect that God ſhould work upon us ſuitably to the nature of the Doctrine which we believe, that he ſhould give by a giving Doctrine, and exact by an exacting Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, The way of procuring Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the condition of perfect or ſincere Works, is not a rational method for the Recovery of fallen Man, though it were good for the preſerving of Life before the Fall, it preſcribeth the immediate Practice of Holineſs to recover a Man dead in Sin. As if one ſhould ſay to the ſick of the Palſie, <hi>Ariſe up and walk, and then you ſhall be whole and able to walk.</hi> We ſometimes ſay jeſtingly to a Child that is fallen on the ground, <hi>Come hither, and I will help thee up;</hi> but if we ſhould ſay to one that is caſt on his Bed by a dead Palſie, we ſhould be guilty of mocking and cruel inſulting over the Afflicted. Thoſe that are humbled and made ſenſible of their original Sin and natural Deadneſs, know that they muſt firſt live by the Spirit, before they can act holily, <hi>Gal,</hi> 5.25. They will enquire, <hi>How ſhall we have ſtrength to perform the Duty required?</hi> If you anſwer that they muſt truſt in God and Chriſt to help them, they may readily reply, They have no ſure Ground to truſt on God or Chriſt for any ſaving Grace, according to this Doctrine, before
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:96243:64"/>they have performed this Condition, at leaſt in a ſincere Reſolution of Obedience, and that they are as unable to bring their Hearts to ſuch a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a dead Man is to raiſe himſelf out of the Grave. Take another Inſtance, the method of the Doctrine of Works is, you muſt love God firſt, and then on that Condition he will love you again; whereas on the contrary, we love God becauſe he loved us firſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. and if God ſuſpend his Love to us upon any condition, our Love to him will not be abſolute, but ſuſpended upon the ſame condition, and no way contrary to an actual ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, The Law is ſo far from healing our ſinful Corruption, that it proveth rather an Occaſion of ſinful motions and actings in thoſe that ſeek Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Works of it. This cometh to paſs by reaſon of the Power of our natural Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is ſtirred up and rageth the more, when the holy and juſt Law of God is ſet in oppoſition againſt it, ſo that the fault is not in the Law, but in our own hearts. Thoſe that find not this by their own Experience ſhould believe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who teacheth it plainly, and that from his own Experience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. <hi>to the</hi> 14. He affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that there are motions of Sin by the Law in a fleſhly State, and that Sin taketh occaſion by the Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet,</hi> wrought in him all manner of Concupiſcence, deceived him, flew him, became exceeding ſinful, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law he was alive and ſin dead, but when the Commandment came, Sin revived and he died. He ſheweth that the cauſe of this irreconcileable enmity and contrariety betwixt his ſinful Nature and the Law; <hi>the law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96243:65"/>ſold under ſin.</hi> Take notice here that the Reaſon given by the Apoſtle that the Doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſincere Obedience will have the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Corrupt Nature is contrary to ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as well as perfect, and if we make it the condition of our Salvation, Sin will take the ſame occaſion by it to become exceeding ſinful in its motions and actings. The Succeſs of legal Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine upon the natural Man is according to the Proverb, <hi>Reprove not a ſcorner lest he hate thee,</hi> Prov. 9.8. Rebuking a mad Man is the way to enrage him, and ſuch is the natural Man in ſpiritual things ſince he fell out of his right Mind by the Sin of <hi>Adam.</hi> We find by manifold Experience, that though Men be generally addicted to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Salvation by Works, yet multitudes of of them hate all ſtrict Preachers and Profeſſors of true Holineſs, becauſe they are a Torment to their Conſciences. They endeavour to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Ignorance of the Law, accounting that the leſs they know, the leſs they ſhall anſwer for, and therefore they would not have right things propheſied unto them, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 30.10. And they have prevailed generally in the World to darken the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge of moral Duties in ſuch a Degree that there is a neceſſity of learning them by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation out of the Scriptures. We may find how prone Legal-writers are to corrupt the Senſe of the Law, that they may leave ſtarting holes for their Corruptions, by the corrupt Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Scribes and Phariſees from which Chriſt did vindicate it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And as far as I have obſerved, none more endeavour to diſcover the Purity and Perfection of the Law, than thoſe that ſeek Holineſs and Salvation, without any Legal
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96243:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>Condition by the meer Free grace of God in Chriſt. The Doctrine of Salvation by ſincere Obedience, is but a mincing of the Perfection required in the Law, and yet how is this Doctrine minced again and again until it be come ſo ſmall, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all true Obedience is loſt, without any farther Practice of Holineſs. A willingneſs to be ſaved according to Chriſt's terms, or a Conſent that Chriſt ſhould be our Lord, or a Reſolution to obey his Commandments (which is little more than ignorant men truſt on, when they ſay that they hope God will ſave them, becauſe they have a good meaning, tho' they live in the neglect of all Religion) ſhall paſs with many for enough ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience both to enter them into a State of Salvation, and to continue them in it, ſo that they ſhall never be accounted Breakers of the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covenant while ſo much can be pretended. The moſt that is made neceſſary for Salvation, ſhall be only to endeavour to do what we can to obey Chriſt's Commands, tho' all that the moſt can do is nothing that is truly good. Thoſe that have a little more Zeal for their Salvation by Works, are prone to ſpend it in ſuperſtitious Obſervances, becauſe they ſuit better with their carnal Nature than the ſpiritual Commands of God and Chriſt. I doubt not but this hath been one occaſion of the prevailing of <hi>Heatheniſh, Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlitions in the World. We find by experience how <hi>Popery</hi> fell in ſeveral Nations in late years when the great Pillar of it, the Doctrine of Juſtification by Works, was overthrown by the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone. If theſe Legal Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots be forced by ſtrong Conviction to endeavour the Practice of ſpiritual Duties for the quieting of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96243:66"/>their guilty Conſciences, they may be brought to ſtrive and labour earneſtly, and even to macerate their Bodies with Faſting, that they may kill their Luſts, but ſtill their Luſts are alive and as ſtrong as ever they were, and do ſhew forth their Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of God by inward fretting, repining and grudging at it as a grievous Task-maſtertho' a ſlaviſh Fear reſtrain their groſs outward actings. And if once theſe Zealots be enlightned with the Knowledge of the Spiritual nature of the Law, to diſcern that God rejecteth all their ſlaviſh Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and will not own it for ſincere Obedience, then they fall into Deſpair of their Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſee they have failed in their higheſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to perform the Condition, and then they can eaſily diſcover themſelves that their Hearts ſwell in Anger and manifeſt Hatred againſt the Law, yea, and againſt God and Chriſt for preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſuch hard Conditions of Salvation, which they cannot keep, and yet expect to be damned eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for breaking of them. This filleth them with blaſphemous thoughts againſt God and Chriſt, and they can hardly refrain from blaſpheming with their tongues; and when they are brought to this horrible Condition, if God doth not in mercy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to them the way of Salvation by Free-grace, through Faith alone, they will endeavour if they can to ſear their Conſciences paſt feeling of Sin, and fully to abandon all Religion, which have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſuch an unſufferable Torment to them, or if they cannot ſear their Conſciences, ſome of them are eaſily prevailed over by Satan, rather to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves than to live longer in the Hatred of God, the Spirit of Blaſphemy and continual hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of Conſcience. This is the peſtilent effect of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96243:66"/>Legal-Doctrine upon a carnal heart, that doth but rouſe up and terribly enrage the ſleeping Lion, our ſinful Gorruption inſtead of killing of it, as is too evident by the ſad Experience of many that have endeavoured with all their might to practice it, and by the Scripture that ſheweth a ſufficient cauſe why it cannot be otherwiſe. Therefore the Doctrine of Salvation by ſincere Obedience, that was invented againſt <hi>Antinomianiſm,</hi> may well be ranked amongſt the worſt <hi>Antinomian</hi> Errors. For my part I hate it with perfect Hatred and count it mine Enemy, as I have found it to be, and I have found by ſome good Experience the Truth of the Leſſon taught by the Apoſtle, that the way to be freed from the Maſtery and Dominion of Sin, <hi>is not to be under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.15.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly, The way of Salvation by works was blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Curſe denounced againſt the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, ſo that now it cannot work Life in us or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but only Death: For the Law which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both ſincere and perfect Obedience to God in all things, was made known to <hi>Adam</hi> at his firſt Creation, as the means of continuing the happy Life that was then beſtowed upon him; and it would have been effectual for this end if he had not tranſgreſſed in the forbidden fruit, but when he had once brought himſelf and his Poſterity under the terrible Sentence, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2.17. all that Knowledge of God or his Law that before wrought for continuance of Life, was turned by that curſing Sentence the contrary way to work for his death, even for the death of his Soul in ſin, as well as for the death of his Body, and therefore it quickly moved him to hide himſelf from God as an enemy. It was as if God ſhould ſay, <hi>All the light and knowledge that thou haſt, ſhall not be able to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96243:67"/>thy life or reſtore it, but it ſhall rather tend to thy death.</hi> Therefore while we continue in our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate under the firſt <hi>Adam</hi>'s Guilt and Curſe, the knowledge of the Law, yea, and all ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and his Attributes as natural Men may attain to, muſt needs be in like manner accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us; and ſeeing Man did not uſe his natural Knowledge and Wiſdom aright, God is reſolved to revenge the abuſe of it by giving us Salvation in a way contrary to it, that ſeemeth fooliſhneſs to the Natural man and wholly to aboliſh the way of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by any of our works, or by any Wiſdom or Knowledge that the Natural-man can attain unto; for it is written, <hi>I will deſtrey the wiſdom of the wiſe, and will bring to nothing the underſtanding of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of the world: For after that in the wiſdom of God, the world by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.19, 20, 21. Hence we may conclude, that no Truth known by the light of Nature can be an effectual Principle or Motive to work Holineſs in us, and Goſpel-princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Motives are but abuſed, when they are applied to a Legal-way of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="7">7thly, The end which God aimed at in giving the Law by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was not that any ſhould ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to Holineſs or Salvation by the condition of perfect or ſincere Obedience to it, tho' if there had been any ſuch way of Salvation at that time, it muſt have conſiſted in the Performance of that Law which was then given to the Church to be a Rule of Life as well as a Covenant. There was another Covenant made before that time with <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> a Covenant of Grace promiſing all Bleſſings freely through Chriſt, the promiſed Seed, by which only they were to be ſaved, and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:96243:67"/>of the Law was added that they might-ſee their ſinfulneſs and ſubjection to death and wrath, and the impoſſibility of attaining to life or holineſs by their works, and be forced to truſt on the free Promiſe only for all their Salvation, and that Sin might be reſtrained by the Spirit of Bondage, until the coming of that promiſed Seed Jeſus Chriſt, and the more plentiful pouring out of the ſanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by him. This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth largely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.15 <hi>to</hi> 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, 4. None of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under the Old Teſtament were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaved by the <hi>Sinai</hi>-Covenant, neither did any of them ever attain to Holineſs by the terms of it. Some of them did indeed perform the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it ſincerely, tho' imperfectly, but thoſe were firſt juſtified and made Partakers of Life and Holineſs by virtue of that better Covenant made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which was the ſame in ſubſtance with the New-covenant or Teſtament, eſtabliſh'd by the Blood of Chriſt. Had it not been for that better Covenant, the <hi>Sinai</hi>-covenant would have proved to them an occaſion of no Happineſs, but only of ſin, Deſpair and Deſtruction. Of it ſelf it was only a killing Letter, the miniſtration of death and condemnation, and therefore it is now aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 8, 9, 11. We have cauſe to praiſe God for delivering his Church by the Blood of Chriſt from this Yoke of Bondage, and we have cauſe to abhor the Device of thoſe that would lay upon us a more grievous and terrible Yoke, by turning our very New covenant into a Covenant of ſincere works, and leaving us no ſuch better Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had under their Yoke, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us in our Extremity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>We are not to imagine that our hearts and lives must be changed from Sin to Holineſs in any meaſure, before we may ſafely venture to trust on Christ for the ſure Enjoyment of himſelf and his Salvation..</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>WE are naturally ſo prone to ground our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon our own works, that if we cannot make them procuring Conditions and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of our Salvation by Chriſt, yet we ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at leaſt to make them neceſſary Preparatives to fit us for receiving Chriſt and his Salvation by Faith. And Men are eaſily perſwaded that this is not at all contrary to Salvation by Free-grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that is hereby aſcribed to our works or good Qualifications, is only that they put usin a ſit poſture to receive a Free gift. If we were to go to a Prince for a Free giſt, good Manners and due Reverence would teach us to trim our ſelves firſt and to change our ſlovenly Clothes as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did when he came out of the Dungeon into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> It ſeemeth to be an impudent ſlighting and contemning the Juſtice and Holineſs of God and Chriſt, and an inſufferable affront and indignity offer'd to the divine Majeſty, when any dare preſume to approach into his Preſence in the naſty pickle of his Sins, covered all over with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifying Sores not at all clo'sd, boundeup or clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; much more when they endeavour to receive
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96243:68"/>the moſt holy One into ſuch an abominable ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kennel, as a Sinners heart is before it be at all reformed. The Parable concerning the Man that was to be bound hand and foot and caſt into out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Darkneſs for coming to the Royal Wedding without a Wedding garment, ſeemeth to be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Warning againſt all ſuch Preſumption, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.11, 13. Many that behold with terrour the abominable Filth of their own hearts are kept off from coming immediately to Chriſt by ſuch Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations which Satan ſtrongly maintaineth and increaſeth in them by his Suggeſtions, ſo that they can by no means be perſwaded out of them, until God teacheth them inwardly by the powerful Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of his Spirit; they delay the ſaving act of Faith, becauſe they account that they are not yet duly prepared and qualified for it. On the ſame Account many weak Believers delay coming to the Lord's Supper for many Years together, even as long as they live in this World, and would be as likely to delay their Baptiſm, if they had not been baptized in Infancy. Againſt all ſuch Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ſhall propoſe the following Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This Error is pernicious to the Practice of Holineſs, and to our whole Salvation, in the ſame manner with that treated of in the foregoing Direction, and may be confuted by the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which are there produced; whether Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be made a procuring Condition of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through Chriſt, or only a Condition neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to qualifie us for the Reception of Chriſt, we are equally brought under thoſe Legal terms of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt the Duties required in the Law, that ſo we may live. Therefore we are equally bereaved of the Aſſiſtance of thoſe means of Holineſs menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:96243:69"/>in the foregoing Directions, as Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt, and the Enjoyment of all his ſanctifying Endowments by Faith, which ſhould go before the Practice of Holineſs, that they may enable us for it, and we are equally left to labour in vain for Holineſs while we are in our curſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State, whereby our ſinſul Corruption will be rather exaſperated than mortified, ſo that we ſhall never be duly prepared for the reception of Chriſt, as long as we live in the world. Thus while we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prepare our way to Chriſt by holy Qualifications, we do rather fill it with ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks and deep pits, whereby our Souls are hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ever attaining to the Salvation of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, Any the leaſt change of our hearts and lives from Sin to Holineſs before our receiving of Chriſt and his Salvation by Faith, is not at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary according to the Terms of the Goſpel, nor required by any one Syllable in the Word of God. Chriſt would have the vileſt Sinners come to him for Salvation immediately without delaying the time to prepare themſelves for him. When the wicked Jaylor enquired, what he muſt do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Paul</hi> directed him forthwith to believe on Chriſt, with a Promiſe that in ſo doing he ſhould be ſaved, and ſtraitway he and all his were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 33. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not tell him that he muſt reform his heart and life firſt, though he was in a very naſty pickle at that time, having but a little before faſtened <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the Stocks, and newly attempted an horrid wilful ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murder. Thoſe three thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> that were converted by <hi>Peter</hi>'s Preaching, and added the ſame day to the Church by Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. ſeemed to have as much need of ſome conſiderable
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96243:69"/>time to prepare themſelves for receiving of Chriſt as others, becauſe they had but lately polluted themſelves with the Murder of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Chriſt commands his Servants to go out quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Streets and Lanes of the City and to bring in to his Feaſt, the poor and the maimed, and the halt and the blind, yea to go out into the high ways and to compel them to come in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowing them to tarry away until they had cleanſed the ſores and ſhifted off their filthy rags and ſwarms of lice. Chriſt would have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not require us to be godly before we believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. He came as a Phyſician for the Sick, and doth not expect that they ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Health in the leaſt degree before they come to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. The vileſt Sinners are fitly prepared and qualified for this Deſign, which is to ſhew forth the exceeding riches of Grace, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our ſins and ſaving us freely, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5. 7. For this end the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> entered, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence might abound, that ſo where <hi>ſin abounded grace might much more abound,</hi> Rom. 5.20. He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us in our moſt loathſom ſinful Pollution, ſo as to die for us, and much more will he love us in it, ſo as to receive us when we come to him for the purchaſed Salvation. He hath given full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Juſtice of God for ſinners, that they might have all Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, and all Salvation only by Fellowſhip with him through Faith; therefore it is no affront to Chriſt, or ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contemning of the Juſtice and Holineſs of God to come to Chriſt, while we are polluted ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but rather it is an affronting and contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Saving-grace, Merit and Fulneſs of Chriſt,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:96243:70"/>if we endeavour to make our ſelves righteous and holy before we receive Chriſt himſelf, and all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Holineſs in him by Faith. Chriſt loathed not to touch a Leper, and condeſcended to waſh the feet of his Diſciples, and did not expect that they ſhould be waſhed and perfumed before hand, as ſome great ones of the World are ſaid to do, when they waſh the feet of Poor-men in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thoſe that receive Chriſt with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Faith, ſhall never want a wedding garment to adorn them in the ſight of God. Faith it ſelf is very precious in the ſight of God and moſt holy, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Jude</hi> 20. God loveth it becauſe it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the glory of our Salvation only to the Free-grace of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. and renounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all dependance on any conditions that we can perform to procure a Right to Chriſt, or to make our ſelves acceptable to him. It containeth in it an hearty Love to Chriſt as Saviour, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting Appetite for his Salvation: and it is the Mouth whereby the Soul feedeth hungri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him. What Wedding garment can ſinners bring with them more delightful than this to their bountiful God, whoſe great Deſign is to manifeſt the abundant riches of his glorious Grace and Bounty in this Wedding feaſt? The Father himſelf loveth them, becauſe they love Chriſt, and believe that he came out from God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 16.27. But yet we ſee that the Excellency of Faith lyeth in this that it accounteth not it ſelf or any other work of ours, a ſufficient Ornament to make us accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the ſight of God. It will not be our Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment it ſelf, but it buyeth of Chriſt white raiment that we may be clothed, and that the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:96243:70"/>ſhame of our nakedneſs may not appear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. Tho' it loveth and deſireth the Free-gift of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet it abandons all thoughts of practiſing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs immediately before we come to Chriſt for an holy nature. It putteth on Chriſt himſelf, and in him all things that pertain to life and godlineſs. Thus every true Believer is clothed with the Sun, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.1. even with the Sun of Righteouſneſs the Lord Jeſus, who is pleaſed to be himſelf both our Wedding-garment and Feaſt, and all our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal Happineſs. For the more full Satisfaction and Conſolation of thoſe diſtreſſed Souls that lye under the terrible apprehenſions of their own ſinfulneſs and the wrath of God, and dare not venture to truſt ſtedfaſtly on Chriſt, for their Salvation, until they can find in themſelves ſome change from Sin to Holineſs. I ſhall mention particularly ſeveral of thoſe things that ſuch would find in themſelves, and I ſhall ſhew that if ſome of them be not partly comprehended in Faith it ſelf, they are fruits and conſequences of Faith, and therefore they cannot be rationally expected before we truſt on Chriſt for our Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They think it neceſſary to repent before they believe on Chriſt for their Salvation, becauſe Repentance is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh;</hi> and Chriſt placeth the Duty of Repentance before Faith, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.15. Repent and believe the Goſpel; but we are to know that Chriſt requireth Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance firſt as the end to be aimed at, and Faith in the next place, as the only means of attaining to it; and tho' the end be firſt in intention, yet the means are firſt in Practice and Execution, tho' both be abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation. For what
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96243:71"/>is Repentance, but an hearty turning from ſin to God and his Service? and what way is there to turn to God, but through Chriſt? <hi>who is the way, the truth and the life, without whom none cometh to the Father,</hi> Joh. 14.6. And what way is there of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt, but by Faith? therefore if we would turn to God in the right way, we muſt firſt come to Chriſt by Faith, and Faith muſt go before Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as the great Inſtrument afforded us by the Grace of God for the effectual Performance of it. Repentance is indeed a Duty which ſinners owe naturally to God; but the great Queſtion is, how ſhall ſinners be able to perform it? This Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is reſolved only by the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe.</hi> The way to repent is to begin with believing. Therefore the great Doctrine of <hi>John</hi> in his Baptiſm of Repentance was, That they <hi>ſhould believe on him that ſhould come after him,</hi> that is, on Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly Regeneration alſo is neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3 3. and therefore many would find it wrought in themſelves, before they truſt on Chriſt for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but conſider what Regeneration is, It is a new begetting or creating us in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. in whom we are Partakers of a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture far different from that which we received from the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> Now Faith is the uniting Grace whereby Chriſt dwelleth in us, and we in him, as hath been ſhewed, and therefore it is the firſt Grace wrought in our Regeneration and the means of all the reſt; when you truly believe, you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated and not till then. Thoſe that receive Chriſt by believing, and thoſe only are the Sons of God, <hi>which are born not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1.12, 13.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:96243:71"/>
               <p n="3">3dly, They account it neceſſary to receive Chriſt as Lord and Law-giver by a ſincere Reſignation of themſelves to his Government, and a Reſolution to obey his Law, before they receive him as their Saviour. This is one principal Leſſon of the new Divinity, and ſuch a receiving Chriſt as Lord is made to be the great act of ſaving Faith, without which ſuch Faith as I have deſcribed, whereby we truſt on Chriſt for Salvation, is reckoned no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than groſs Preſumption. They teach that Chriſt will not beſtow his Salvation on thoſe that do not firſt yield their ſubjection to his Kingly Authority, but he calleth them his enemies, becauſe they would not that he ſhould reign over them, and requireth that they be brought and ſlain before him, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. And I own it as a certain truth, that Chriſt will ſave none but thoſe that are brought to reſign up themſelves ſincerely to the Obedience of his royal Authority and Laws. But yet we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that they are not brought to this holy Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, or to any ſincere purpoſe and reſolution of Obedience before they receive his Salvation, but rather by receiving it. Men that were never through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of their natural death in ſin, do eaſily bring themſelves to reſolve univerſal Obedience to God when they are on their Death-beds, or in any eminent danger, or when they would prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Lords Supper, that ſo they may make their Peace with God, and truſt ſecurely on Chriſt for his Salvation, but all Reſolutions of that kind are vain and hypocritical, ſooner broken than made. Thoſe that know the Plague of their own hearts, do find that their mind is enmity unto the Law of God and Chriſt and cannot be ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. and that they can as ſoon remove
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96243:72"/>a mountain as give up themſelves ſincerely to O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience before they truſt on Chriſt for his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the gift of a new heart, whereby they may be enabled both to will and to do any thing that is acceptable to God. We ſhould have been ſufficiently obliged to all obedient purpoſes, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſignations, if Chriſt had never come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to ſave us, but he knew that we could perform nothing holily, except he made us firſt Partakers of Salvation, and that we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obey him as Law-giver, until we receive him as Saviour. He is a ſaving Lord, truſt on him firſt to ſave you from the guilt and power of ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and dominion of Satan, and to give you a new ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Diſpoſition, then and not till then, the Love of Chriſt will conſtrain you to reſign up your ſelf heartily to live to him that died for you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. and you will be able to ſay with an unfeigned Reſolution, <hi>O Lord, truly I am thy ſervant, I am thy ſervant and the ſon of thy handmaid, thou hast looſed my bonds,</hi> Pſal. 116.16.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, It ſeemeth to them evident, that ſome good works are neceſſary before we can truſt on Chriſt ſafely for the forgiveneſs of ſins; becauſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teacheth us, that if we forgive not men their Treſpaſſes, neither will our heavenly Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our Treſpaſſes, and directeth us to pray, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</hi> Mat. 6.12, 15. Reſtitution alſo was to be made of things wrongfully gotten from others, before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Atonement was made by the Treſpaſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.5, 7. This is ſufficient to prove, that forgiving others, and Reſtitution according to our ability, or at leaſt a ſincere deſire and purpoſe ſo to do, are very cloſely joyned with the forgiveneſs of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96243:72"/>our ſins, and are very neceſſary to fit us for Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and for Sacramental Applications of pardoning Grace to our ſelves. A lively Faith cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe Fruits, and therefore we cannot pray or partake of Sacraments in Faith without them, but yet if we ſtrive to do either of theſe before we truſt on Chriſt for our Pardon and Salvation, we ſhall do them ſlaviſhly and hypocritically, not in any holy acceptable manner. Our forgiving others will not be accompanied with any hearty Love to them as to our ſelves for the ſake of God; and our Reſtitution will be but a forced act, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s letting the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, or like <hi>Judas</hi> reſtoring the thirty pieces of Silver being compelled thereunto by terror of Spirit, and when the terror that forced us is removed, we ſhall be as ready to recal our Forgiveneſs and to wrong others again, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was to bring the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> again into bondage after he had let them go, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.5. If you would forgive others heartily ſo as to love them again, you muſt firſt apprehend the love and mercy of God towards your ſelves by Faith in Chriſt, and then you will be able according to the Apoſtle's Inſtruction, <hi>to be kind, tender hearted, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you,</hi> Epheſ. 4.32. The readineſs of <hi>Zacche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to make Reſtitution, followed upon a diſcovery of Chriſt's love to him, and his joyful receiving Chriſt into his houſe, was fruit whereby he did evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Truth of that Faith that was already wrought in his heart.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, I ſhall reckon up together ſeveral other Qualifications, that diſtreſſed Souls would find in themſelves, that they may be duly prepared to truſt on Chriſt for their Salvation, and when they have
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96243:73"/>laboured anxiouſly a long time and cannot get them, at laſt they lie down in ſorrowful Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, not daring to apply the Conſolations of the grace of God in Chriſt to their wounded Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Let perplexed Souls mark the particulars and obſerve whether the condition of their own Souls be reached in any of them, O thou afflicted, toſſed with tempeſts, and not comforted, what good Qualifications is it that thou wouldeſt have, that thou mayeſt be encouraged to lay hold on Chriſt for Salvation? It is likely thou wilt anſwer in the bitterneſs of thy Soul, O let me have firſt ſome love to God and Godlineſs in mine heart, and freedom from mine hateful heart-riſings againſt him and his Service. Let me have ſome good thoughts of God, his Juſtice, Mercy, Holineſs, that I may be able to juſtifie him tho' he damn me, and that I may not be filled with murmuring and helliſh Blaſphemies in my mind againſt him, let the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of my luſts be abated, and the ſtinking kennel of my wicked heart a little cleanſed, let me have ſome holy reverential Fear of God, and not only a pannick tormenting horror. I would be more affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the wrath of God, and not be of a ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heedleſs Spirit. I would be more humbled for Sin, loath it and be aſhamed of it, and be ſorry for it with a godly Sorrow, not meerly becauſe of the Puniſhment, but becauſe it grieveth and vexeth the holy Spirit of God, I would be able to make a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ingenious Confeſſion of ſin, and to pour out my Soul to the Lord in lively affectionate Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for Forgiveneſs, and to praiſe and glorifie him heartily, and not to be like a lifeleſs ſtone in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Prayer as I am. Are theſe the things thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, O poor diſtreſſed Soul? The beſt Reply I can
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96243:73"/>make for thy ſpeedy comfort, is to inform thee, that the things are good but thy deſires are not well timed, it is unreaſonable for thee to expect theſe holy Qualifications whilſt thou art in thy natural State under the guilt of Sin and the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Wrath of God, before thou haſt received the Atonement, and the new Spiritual Life that is by Chriſt through Faith in his Name, thou doſt but exaſperate thy Corruptions, and harden thy Heart, and make thy wounds to ſtink the more becauſe of thy fooliſhneſs; ſuch good Qualifications are included in the Nature of Faith, and for the moſt part they follow after it, ſo that they cannot poſſibly be obtained before thou truſteſt in Chriſt for thy Salvation, as I ſhall ſhew concerning them particularly in their Order. A love to the Salvation of God, and to the free Gift of Holineſs is included in the Nature of Faith, ſo that it cannot be hearty without it. Act Faith firſt with this kind of Love, and the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of God's Love to thy Soul will ſweetly allure and conſtrain thee to love God and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice univerſally: We love him becauſe he loved us firſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. We cannot be before-hand with God in love, and we muſt perceive it to make us love him, for if we look upon him as a God contrary to us that hateth us and will damn us, our own innate Self-love will breed hatred and heart-riſings againſt him, in ſpite of our Hearts, that love which is the end of the Law muſt flow from Faith unfeigned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. And if Hatred work in thee more than Love, how canſt thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect good thoughts of God, or any other than blaſpheming, or at leaſt murmuring thoughts of him, in this condition, ill-will never ſpeaketh or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96243:74"/>thinketh well. The firſt right holy Thoughts thou canſt have of God are thoughts of his Grace and Mercy to thy Soul in Chriſt, which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Grace of Faith. Get theſe thoughts firſt by believing in Chriſt, and they will breed in thee love to God, and all good thoughts of him, and free thee from blaſphemous and murmuring Thoughts by degrees, <hi>for love thinks no evil,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.9. Then wilt thou be able to account God juſt and merciful if he had damned thee and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Grace to others; and thou wilt be able to think well of his Holineſs, and of his Decrees which many cannot endure to hear of. The way to get rid of thy raging Luſts is by Faith, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth the Heart and worketh by Love, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. The Soul muſt be brought to take pleaſure in God and Chriſt by Faith, or elſe it will luſt after fleſhly and worldly Pleaſures; and the more you ſtrive againſt Luſts without Faith, the more they are ſtirred up, though you prevail ſo far as to reſtrain the fulfilling of them: beg a holy Fear of God, with fear of coming ſhort of the promiſed Reſt through unbelief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. Such a Fear is an Ingredient of Faith, and it will breed in us a reverential, yea, a Child-like fear of God and his Goodneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. We muſt have Grace whereby we may ſerve God with Reverence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is in the Margent we muſt have or hold faſt Grace, and there is no other way to hold faſt Grace but by Faith, and this will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calm all pannick and tormenting Horror. And if you would be free from careleſneſs and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Wrath of God, your way is firſt to avoid diſpairing by believing; for People grow careleſs by diſpairing, and for their own quiet they will
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96243:74"/>endeavour to ſlight Evils which they have no hope to prevent, according to the Proverb, <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we ſhall die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.32. True Humiliation for Sin is either a part or fruit of Faith, for on our believing we ſhall remember our own evil ways and doings that were not good, and ſhall loath our ſelves in our own ſight for all our Abominations, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31. We ſhall alſo then willingly renounce our own Righteouſneſs, and account it but dung, that we may win Chriſt by Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. But Beggars will make the moſt of all their naſty Rags, till they be furniſhed with better Cloaths; and Cripples will not caſt away their Crutches until they have a better ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to lean on. Godly Sorrow for Sin is wrought in us by believing the pardoning Grace of God, as it is found by experience, that a Pardon from a Prince will ſometimes ſooner draw tears from a ſtubborn Malefactor than the fear of a Halter will; thus the ſinful Woman was brought to waſh Chriſt's Feet with her Tears, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.37, 38. We are not like to be ſorry for grieving God with our Sins while we look upon him, as an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy that will eaſe himſelf well enough of his burthen, and right himſelf upon us by our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction. The belief of God's pardoning and accepting Grace is a neceſſary means to bring us to an ingenuous Confeſſion of Sins. The People freely confeſſed their ſins when they were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of <hi>John</hi> in <hi>Jordan for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Mark 1.4, 5. The Confeſſion of Deſpairers is forced, like the extorted Confeſſions and Cryings out of Malefactors upon the Rack. A Pardon ſooner o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth the Mouth to an ingenuous Confeſſion, than confeſs and be hanged, or confeſs and be
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96243:75"/>damned; therefore if you would freely confeſs your ſins, believe firſt that God is faithful and juſt to forgive your ſins through Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. And if you would pray to God, or praiſe him with lively Affections, you muſt firſt believe that God will hear you, and give you what is beſt for you for Chriſt's ſake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23, 24. otherwiſe your praying will be only from the Teeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for how ſhall you <hi>call on him on whom you have not believed,</hi> Rom. 10.14. You muſt come firſt to Chriſt, the Altar by Faith, that by him you may offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe to God continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10, 15.</p>
               <p>Finally, to paſs from Particulars to the general Aſſertion laid down in the Direction, if you ask, What ſhall we do that we may work the Works of God, or get any ſaving Qualifications? I muſt direct you firſt to Faith, as the Work of Works, and the great ſaving Preparatory to all good Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by anſwering in our Saviour's words, <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe in him whom he hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 6.28, 29.</p>

               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>I Hope the Reader will obſerve warily in all theſe Directions, that the Holineſs aimed at as the great End in the whole Diſcourſe, conſiſteth not in the Grace or Act of Faith required pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly by the Goſpel, which though it be a ſaving Gift of Chriſt, yet is here conſidered rather as a means precedent to the Reception of Chriſt and all his Salvation, then a part of his Salvation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. But the Holineſs aimed at, conſiſteth in Conformity to the whole Moral Law, to which we are naturally obliged if their had never been any Goſpel, or any ſuch Duty as believing in Chriſt for Salvation.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:96243:76"/>
               <p>Now in this Direction, three Things are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that are very neceſſary to guide us to the attainment of this great End, and therefore wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our ſerious Conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a Matter of high concern, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the due Place and Order, wherein God hath ſettled this holy Practice in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Salvation, and a great Point of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Wiſdom to ſeek it only in that order; we know that God is the God of Order, and that his infinite Wiſdom hath appeared in appointing the Order of his Creatures, which we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to obſerve for attainment of our ends in worldly things; ſo alſo in Spiritual things God hath made an everlaſting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. the Benefits of it have an orderly dependence each upon other, as Links of the ſame golden Chain, though ſeveral of them, and a Title to them all are given to us at one and the ſame time; and I think enough hath been ſaid already, to ſhew in what order God brings us to the Practice of the Moral Law, he maketh us firſt to be in Chriſt by Faith as Branches in the Vine, that we may bring forth much fruit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. He firſt purgeth our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences from dead Works by Juſtification, that we may <hi>ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us firſt to <hi>live in the Spirit,</hi> and then to <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.25. This is the Order pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the Goſpel, which is the Power of God unto Salvation; though the Law preſcribeth a quite contrary Method, that we ſhould firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its Commandements, that ſo we may be
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96243:76"/>juſtified and live, and thereby it proveth a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Letter to us: Now mark well the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages you have for the Attainment of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by ſeeking it in a right Goſpel-Order, you will have the Advantage of the Love of God manifeſted toward you in forgiving your Sins, receiving you into Favour, and giving you the Spirit of Adoption, and the Hope of his Glory freely through Chriſt, to perſwade and conſtrain you by ſweet allurements to love God again that hath ſo dearly loved you, and to love others for his ſake, and to give up your ſelves to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all his Commandments out of hearty love to him, you will alſo enjoy the Help of the Spirit of God to incline you powerfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Obedience, and to ſtrengthen you for the Performance of it againſt all your Corruptions, and the Temptations of Satan, ſo that you will have both Wind and Tide to forward your Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the Practice of Holineſs; contrariwiſe if you ruſh upon the immediate performance of the Law, without taking Chriſt's Righteouſneſs and his Spirit in the way to it, you'll find both Wind Tide againſt you. Your guilty Conſcience and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt dead Natures ſhall certainly defeat and fruſtrate all your Enterprizes and Attempts to love God, and ſerve him in Love, and you will but ſtir up ſinful Luſts inſtead of ſtirring up your ſelves to true Obedience, or at beſt you will but attain to ſome ſlaviſh hypocritical Performances; Oh, that People would be perſwaded to conſider the due place of Holineſs in the Myſtery of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſeek it only there where they have all the Advantage of Goſpel-Grace to find it. Many miſcarry in their zealous Enterprizes for

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to look upon Holineſs as a very neceſſary part of that Salvation that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Faith in Chriſt; ſome are ſo drenched with a Covenant of Works, that they accuſe us for making good Works needleſs to Salvation, if we will not acknowledge them to be neceſſary ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Conditions to procure an Intereſt in Chriſt, or as Preparatives to fit us for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of him by Faith; and others when they are taught by the Scriptures that we are ſaved by Faith, through Faith without Works, do begin to diſregard all Obedience to the Law, as not at all neceſſary to Salvation, and do account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to it only in point of Gratitude; if it be wholly neglected, they doubt not but Free-grace will ſave them harmleſs; yea, ſome are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to ſuch ſtrong Antinomian Deluſions, that they account it a part of the Liberty from the Bondage of the Law purchaſed by the Blood of Chriſt, to make no Conſcience of breaking the Law in their Converſation: One cauſe of theſe Errors that are ſo contrary one to the other is, that many are prone to imagine nothing elſe to be meant by Salvation, but to be delivered from Hell, and in heavenly Happineſs and Glory; hence they conclude, that if good Works be a means of Glorification, and precedent to it, they muſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96243:77"/>alſo be a precedent Means of our whole Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that if they be not a neceſſary Means of our whole Salvation, they are not at all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Glorification. But though Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be often taken in Scripture by way of Eminency, for its perfection in the State of heavenly Glory, yet according to its full and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Signification, we are to underſtand by it all that freedom from the Evil of our Natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt State, and all thoſe holy and happy Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we receive from Chriſt our Saviour, either in this World by Faith, or in the World to come by Glorification. Thus Juſtification, the Gift of the Spirit to dwell in us, the Priviledges of Adoption are parts of our Salvation which we partake of in this Life: Thus alſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our Hearts to the Law of God, and the Fruit of our Righteouſneſs with which we are filled by Jeſus Chriſt in this Life, are a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary part of our Salvation; God ſaveth us from our finful uncleanneſs here by the waſhing of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as from Hell hereafter, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.29. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. Chriſt was called Jeſus, <hi>i.e.</hi> A Saviour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaved his People from their Sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. therefore it is part of our Salvation to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from our Sins, which is begun in this Life by Juſtification and Sanctification, and perfected by Glorification in the Life to come. Can we rationally doubt whither it be any proper part of our Salvation by Chriſt to be quickned to live to God, when we were by nature dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins, and to have the Image of God in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs reſtored to us
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96243:78"/>which we loſt by the Fall, and to be freed from a vile diſhonourable Slavery to Satan and our own Luſts, and made the Servants of God, and to be honoured ſo highly as to walk by the Spirit, and bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit: And what is all this but holineſs in Heart and Life? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude we then that Holineſs in this Life is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, not only as a Means to the end, but by a nobler kind of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as part of the end it ſelf. Though we are not ſaved by good Works as procuring Cauſes, yet we are ſaved to good Works as fruits and effects of Saving-grace, which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared <hi>that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> Eph. 2.10. It is indeed one part of our Salvation to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Bondage of the Covenant of Works, but the end of this is, not that we may have liberty to ſin (which is the worſt of Slavery) but that we may fulfil the royal Law of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and that we may ſerve in newneſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not in the oldneſs of the Letter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13, 14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. Yea Holineſs in this Life is ſuch a part of our Salvation, as is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Means to make us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in heavenly Light and Glory, <hi>without Holineſs we can never ſee God, Heb.</hi> 12.14. and are as unfit for the glorious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as Swine for the Preſence-Chamber of an Earthly Prince. I confeſs ſome may be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when they are ſo near the point of Death, that they may have little time to practice Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in this World, <hi>but the Grace of the Spirit is active like fire,</hi> Mat. 3.11. And as ſoon as it is given it will immediately produce good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96243:78"/>Workings of Love to God, and Chriſt, and his People, which will be ſufficient to manifeſt the righteous Judgment of God in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them at the great Day, when he ſhall judge every Man according to his Work, though ſome poſſibly may not have ſo much Time to diſcover their inward Grace in any outward good Works, as the Thief upon the Croſs, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.40.43.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt thing to be noted in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, is that Holineſs of heart and life is to be ſought for earneſtly by Faith, as a very neceſſary part of our Salvation. Great multitudes of ignorant People that live under the Goſpel harden their hearts in ſin, and ruine their Souls for ever by truſting on Chriſt, for ſuch an imaginary Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as conſiſteth not at all in Holineſs, but only in Forgiveneſs of Sin and Deliverance from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Torments. They would be free from the Puniſhments due to Sin, but they love their Luſts ſo well that they hate Holineſs, and would not be ſaved from the Service of Sin. The way to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this pernicious Deluſion, is not to deny, as ſome do, That truſting on Chriſt for Salvation is a ſaving Act of Faith, but rather to ſhew that none do or can truſt on Chriſt for true Salvation, except they truſt on him for Holineſs, neither do they heartily deſire true Salvation, if they do not deſire to be made holy and righteous in their Hearts and Lives: if ever God and Chriſt, give you Salvation, Holineſs will be one part of it, if Chriſt waſh you not from the filth of your Sins, you <hi>have no part in him,</hi> Joh. 13.8. What a ſtrange
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:96243:79"/>kind of Salvation do they deſire, that care not for Holineſs? They would be ſaved and yet be altogether dead in Sin, Aliens from the Life of God, bereft of the Image of God, deformed by the Image of Satan, his Slaves and Vaſſals to their own filthy Luſts, utterly unmeet for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God in Glory. Such a Salvation as that was never purchaſed by the Blood of Chriſt, and thoſe that ſeek it, abuſe the Grace of God in Chriſt, and turn it into Laſciviouſneſs. They would be ſaved by Chriſt, and yet out of Chriſt in a fleſhly ſtate, whereas God doth free none from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, but thoſe that are in Chriſt, that walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit; or elſe they would divide Chriſt, and take a part of his Salvation, and leave out the reſt, but Chriſt is not divided, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. They would have their Sins forgiven, not that they may walk with God, in Love in time to come, but that they may pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice their Enmity againſt him, without any Fear of Puniſhment; but let them not be deceived, God is not mocked, they underſtand not what true Salvation is, neither were they ever yet throughly ſenſible of their loſt Eſtate, and of the great evil of Sin, and that which they truſt on Chriſt for, is but an Imagination of their own Brains, and therefore their Truſting is groſs Preſumption. True Goſpel Faith maketh us to come to Chriſt with a thirſty Appetite, that we may drink of living Water, even of his ſanctifying Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38. And to cry out earneſtly to ſave us not only from Hell, but from Sin; ſaying, <hi>Teach us to do thy will, thy ſpirit is good,</hi> Pſal. 143.10. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:96243:79"/>Jer. 31.18. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me,</hi> Pſal. 51.10. This is the way whereby the Doctrine of Salvation by Grace, doth neceſſitate us to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Life, by conſtraining us to ſeek for it by Faith in Chriſt, as a ſubſtantial part of that Salvation, which is freely given to us through Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>

               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>SInce Man fell from Obedience to God, which he was enabled and engaged to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by the Comforts of his firſt happy ſtate in Paradice, God might have juſtly refuſed ever to give Man again any Comforts before-hand to encourage him to his Duty; that the way to Holineſs being hedged up againſt him with the Thorns and Briars of Fear, Grief and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, he might never be able to eſcape the Sentence of Death, which was denounced againſt his firſt Tranſgreſſion. This Juſtice of God is manifeſt in the Method of the Legal Covenant, wherein God promiſeth us no Life, Comfort or Happineſs until we have through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed his Law, and may be ſeen in the Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> Promulgation explicated <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. throughout, and we are by Nature ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to this Legal Method of Salvation, that it is a hard matter to diſſwade thoſe that live under the Light of the Goſpel, from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96243:80"/>the Duties of the Law before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Goſpel; if they cannot make Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf, yet they will be ſure to make all the Comforts of it to depend upon their own Works. They think it as unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. Comfort before Duty, as Wages before Work, or the Fruits of the Earth before the Husband Man's Labour, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count the only effectual way to ſecure the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we owe to the Law of God, is to ground all our Comforts on the Performance of it, and that the contrary Doctrine ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Hands of the Wicked by propheſying Peace to them where there is no Peace, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.16, 22. And openeth the Flood-gates to all Licentiouſneſs, therefore ſome Preachers will adviſe Men not to be ſollicitous and haſty of getting of Comfort, but that they ſhould rather exerciſe themſelves diligently in the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their Duty, and they tell them that in ſo doing, their Condition will be ſafe and happy at laſt, though they never enjoy any Comfort of their Salvation, as long as they live in this World.</p>
               <p>That you may rightly underſtand what I have aſſerted in the Direction againſt ſuch vulgar Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, take notice. That I do not make the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place of Goſpel-comfort to be before the Duties of the Law, I acknowledge that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth his People on every ſide, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.21. both before and after the Performance of their Duty, and that the greateſt Conſolations do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after Duty, yet ſome Comforts God giveth to his People before hand, as Advance-money to furniſh them for his Service, though moſt of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:96243:81"/>the Pay comes in afterward. Neither do I hereby ſpeak any Peace to thoſe that continue in their ſinful natural ſtate, for the Comforts that I ſpeak of cannot be received without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting thoſe falſe Confidences, whereby natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Men harden themſelves in Sin, and without that effectual working of the Spirit, whereby we are made good Trees that we may bring forth good Fruit. Though they are given before the ſincere Practice of the Law, yet they are not given to us in our corrupt, ſinful Nature, but in and with the new, holy Nature, which immediately produceth a holy Practice, though it muſt neceſſarily go before, as the Cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Effect, and they are no other than Comforts of thoſe ſpiritual Benefits by which our new Eſtate and Nature is produced, and of which it is conſtituted and made up, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Redemption, Juſtification, Adoption, the Gift of the Spirit, and the like. Neither do I intend here any Tranſport or Raviſhment of Joy and Delight, but only ſuch manner of Comfort as rationally ſtrengthens in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt the Oppreſſion of Fear, Grief and Deſpair which we are liable unto, by reaſon of our natural Sinfulneſs and Miſery.</p>
               <p>This Explanation of the Senſe of my Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is ſufficient to anſwer ſome common Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt it, and I hope the Truth of it will be fully evidenced by the following Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This Truth is a clear Conſectary from thoſe Principles of Holineſs that have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confirmed. I have ſhewed that we muſt have a good Perſwaſion of our Reconciliation
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96243:81"/>with God, and of our Happineſs in Heaven, and of our ſufficient Strength both to will and to do that which is acceptable to God through Jeſus Chriſt, that we may be rationally inclined and bent to the Practice of Holineſs, and that theſe Endowments muſt be had, by receiving of Chriſt himſelf, with his Spirit and all his Fulneſs, by truſting on him for all his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he is freely promiſed to us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and that by this Faith we do as really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt, as our Food by eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now let right Reaſon judge, can we be perſwaded of the Love of God, of our everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs, and our Strength to ſerve God, and yet be without any Comforts: Can the glad Tidings of the Goſpel of Peace be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and Chriſt and his Spirit actually believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Heart, without any Relief to the Soul from oppreſſing Fear, Grief Deſpair? Can the Salvation of Chriſt be comfortleſs, or the Bread and Water of Life, without any ſweet Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to thoſe that feed on him with hungring and thirſting Appetites; God will not give ſuch Benefits as theſe to thoſe that do not deſire and eſteem them above the World, and certainly the very receiving of them will be comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuch, except they receive them blindfold, which they cannot do, when the very giving and beſtowing of them openeth the Eyes of a Sinner, and turns him from Darkneſs to Light, whereby he doth, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, ſee and perceive Spiritually the things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his preſent and future Peace, and reap ſome encouraging and ſtrengthning Comfort thereby to the Practice of Holineſs.</p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:96243:82"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Peace, Joy, Hope, are recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in Scripture, as the Spring of other holy Duties, and Fear and oppreſſing Grief forbidden, as Hinderances to true Religion, <hi>The peace of God keepeth our hearts and minds through Christ Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 4.7. <hi>Be ye not ſorry for the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength,</hi> Nehem. 8.10. <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure,</hi> 1 John 3.3. <hi>Fear hath torment, he that feareth is not made perfect in Love,</hi> 1 John 4.18. This is the Reaſon why the Apoſtle doubleth his Exhortation, to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord always,</hi> as a Duty of exceeding weight and neceſſity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. What are ſuch Duties but Comfort it ſelf, and can we think that theſe Duties are neceſſary to our continuance in an holy Practice, and yet not to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it where the Work is moſt difficult and Encouragement moſt needful? Therefore we muſt make haſte in the firſt place to get a comfortable Frame of Spirit, if we would make haſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and not delay to keep Gods holy Commandments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The uſual Method of Goſpel-Doctrine as it is delivered to us in the holy Scriptures, is firſt to comfort our Hearts, and thereby to eſtabliſh us in every good Word and Work, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.17. And it appears how clearly this method is adjuſted in ſeveral Epiſtles written by the Apoſtles, wherein they firſt acquaint the Churches with the rich Grace of God toward; them in Chriſt, and the ſpiritual Bleſſings which they are made Partakers of, for their ſtrong
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96243:82"/>Conſolation, and then they exhort them to an holy Converſation anſwerable to ſuch Priviledges, and it is not only the Method of whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, but of many particular Exhortations to Duty, wherein the comfortable Benefits of the Grace of God in Chriſt, are made uſe of as Arguments and Motives to ſtir up the Saints to a holy Practice; which comfortable Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits muſt be firſt believed, and the Comfort of them applyed to our own Souls, or elſe they will not be forcible to engage us to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice for which they are intended. To give you a few Inſtances out of a Multitude that might be alledged, we are exhorted to practice holy Duties, becauſe <hi>we are dead to ſin, and alive to God through Jeſus Christ our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6.11. And becauſe <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over us, for we are not under the law but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. <hi>Becauſe we are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, and God will quicken our mortal bodies by his ſpirit dwelling in us,</hi> Rom. 8.9.11, 12. Becauſe <hi>our bodies are the members of Christ and the temples of the Holy Ghost,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.15, 19. Becauſe God <hi>hath made him ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20, 21. And hath <hi>promiſed that he will dwell in us, and walk in us, and be to us a Father, and we ſhall be to him ſons and daughters,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. Becauſe God <hi>hath forgiven us for Ghrist's ſake, and accounteth us his dear children, and Chriſt hath loved us and given himſelf for us, and we that were ſometimes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned are now lightened in the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 4.32. &amp; 5.1, 2, 8. Becauſe we <hi>are riſen with Christ, and when Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, then
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96243:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>we ſhall alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3.1.4. Becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> Heb. 13.5. Becauſe of <hi>the many promiſes</hi> made to us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. Search the Scriptures and you may with delight ſee that is this the Vein that runneth through Goſpel Exhortations, and you may find the like Vein of Comfort running through the Prophetical Exhortations in the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Some may object that the Apoſtles uſed this Method in their Writings to Saints, that had practiſed Holineſs already, that ſo they might continue and increaſe therein. But to that I may eaſily reply, If it be a Method needful for grown Saints, much more then for Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that find the Work of Obedience moſt difficult, and have moſt need of ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; and I hope to ſhew how we may be able to lay hold of theſe Conſolations by Faith in the very firſt Beginning of a holy Life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Goſpel propoſeth Peace and Comfort freely to thoſe that are not yet brought to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, yet if they have Hearts to receive it, they may be converted from Sin to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When the Apoſtles entred into an Houſe, they were firſt to ſay, <hi>Peace be to the houſe,</hi> Luke 10.5. At their very firſt Preaching to Sinners, they acquainted them with the glad Tidings of Salvation by Chriſt, for every one that would receive it as a Free-gift by Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. &amp; 13.26, 32, 38. &amp; 16.30, 31. They aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them if they would but truſt heartily on Chriſt for all his Salvation, they ſhould have it although they were at preſent the chief of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96243:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>which was Comfort ſufficient for all that duly eſteem Spiritual Comfort, hungring and thirſting after it. And this is a Method agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Deſign of the Goſpel, which is to advance the Riches of the Grace of God in all our Spiritual Enjoyments, God will give us his Conſolations before our good Works as well as after them, that <hi>we may know that he giveth us everlaſting conſolation and good hope through grace,</hi> and not through the Procurement of our Works. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Nature of the Duties of the Law requireth a comfortable ſtate of the Soul for the Performance of them. I have before proved ſufficiently, that they require a Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Reconciliation with God, and of our future Happineſs, and Strength, whereby we may be able to walk in holy Obedience; <hi>Joſhuah</hi> muſt be ſtrong and very couragious, that he might obſerve to do according to the Law that <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.7. I ſhall inſtance briefly in the Comforts, without which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great Duties cannot be ſincerely performed. Can we love God and delight in him above all, while we look upon him as our everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy, and apprehend no Love and Mercy in him towards us, that may render him a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Good for us, and lovely in our Eyes? What doleful Melody will the Heart make in the Duty of Praiſe, if we account that all thoſe Perfections, for which we praiſe him, will rather aggravate our Miſery, than make us
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96243:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>happy? What a heartleſs Work will it be to pray to him, and to offer up our ſelves to his Service, if we have no comfortable Hope that he will accept us? Is it poſſible for us to free our ſelves from carking Cares, by caſting our Care upon the Lord, if we do not apprehend that he careth for us? Can we be patient in Affliction with Chearfulneſs, and under Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, except <hi>we have peace with God, and rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.1, 2, 3. What Reaſon can perſwade us to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit willingly according to our Duty, to the Stroak of preſent Death, if God be pleaſed to lay it upon us, when we have no Comforts to relieve us againſt the horrible Fear of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable Torments in Hell for ever.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould be called to ſuffer Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, as our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors in this Nation have done, we ſhould find it neceſſary to abandon the late upſtart Notions that have been bred in a time of Eaſe, and to embrace the comfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of former <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which through the Grace of God made ſo many couragious and joyful Martyrs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The ſtate of thoſe that are to be brought from Sin to Godlineſs, requires neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, that after they be convinced of the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their former falſe Confidences, and of their Deadneſs in Original-ſin, and Subjection to the Wrath of God, they ſhould have a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of new Goſpel Comforts afforded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their fainting Souls to holy Practices.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96243:84"/>How little do many Phyſicians of Souls con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Condition of their unconverted Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, that are altogether without Spiritual Life and Strength, and are or muſt be convinced. He that preſcribeth bodily Exerciſe to a Man lying Bed-ridden under a dead Palſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any effectual means be uſed to ſtrengthen him, deſerveth the name of a mercileſs inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tormentor, rather than of a wiſe and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted Phyſician. How unreaſonable is it to preſcribe the immediate Practice of Love to God, and univerſal Obedience to him out of Love, as the means of Cure; for thoſe that ſee nothing but Wrath and Enmity in God towards them in their preſent Condition, what is it but to require a Man to work without Strength, promiſing him that he ſhall have Strength when his Work is done; for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Fortitude is ſo called, becauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth and ſtrengtheneth. True it is, That the Law which is the Miniſtration of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obligeth them to Obedience; but our merciful God expecteth no ſincere Performance of his Law, from ſuch impotent miſerable Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in order to their Salvation by Chriſt, till he hath firſt delivered them in ſome meaſure from thoſe Diſcomforts, ſlaviſh Fears and Deſpondencies, that hold them captive under the Law of Sin and Death. We may require a ſtrong healthy Perſon, firſt to work and then to expect Meat, Drink and Wages, but a fainting, famiſhed Perſon, muſt firſt have Food, or a reviving Cordial to ſtrengthen his Heart before he can work.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Both Scripture and Experience ſhew, That this is the Method whereby God bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his People from Sin to Holineſs, though ſome of them are brought under Terrours for a while, that Sin may be the more imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and the Salvation of Chriſt rendred more precious and acceptable to them, yet ſuch are again delivered from their Terrors by the Comfort of God's Salvation, that they may be fitted for Holineſs; and generally a holy Life beginneth with Comfort, and is maintained by it. God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> at his firſt Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Comfort of his Love and Favour, and the Happineſs of Paradiſe to encourage him to Obedience, and when he had left thoſe Comforts by the Fall, he was no longer able to obey until he was reſtored by new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the promiſed Seed. Chriſt the Second <hi>Adam</hi> ſet <hi>God always before his face,</hi> and he knew that becauſe <hi>God was at his right hand, he ſhould not be moved, therefore his heart was glad, and his glory rejoyced,</hi> Pſal. 16.8, 9. This made him willing to bear his Agony and bloody Sweat, and to <hi>be obedient unto Death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> God drew the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to Obedience with the Cords of a Man, with the Bonds of Love, by taking off the Yoke on their Jaws, and laying Meat before them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. <hi>David</hi> telleth us for our Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, how he was brought to an holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <hi>Thy loving kindneſs is before mine eyes, and I have walked in thy truth,</hi> Pſal. 26.3. <hi>Lord, I have hoped for thy ſalvation, and done
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96243:85"/>thy Commandements,</hi> Pſal. 119.166. We have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Examples in the New Teſtament of the Joy that Sinners had in the firſt receiving of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. And when the Goſpel firſt came to the <hi>Theſſalonians, they received the Word in much affliction with joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.4, 5. When the Gentiles heard the Word of God they were glad, and as many <hi>as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal Life believed.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was conſtrained by the Love of Chriſt to give up himſelf to live to Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.14, 15. I dare appeal to the Experience of any that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God out of hearty Love, let them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, and conſider whither they were brought to give up themſelves to ſerve God in love, without comfortable apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Love of God towards them, I dare ſay there are no ſuch Prodigies in the new Birth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> What comfortleſs Religion do thoſe make that allow People no comfort before hand to ſtrengthen them for holy Performances that are very croſs, diſpleaſing and grievous to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations, as the plucking out of a right Eye, cutting off of a right Hand, but would have them firſt to do ſuch things with love and delight under all their preſent Fears, Deſpondencies, and corrupt Inclinations, and to hope that by doing the Work throughly and ſincerely they ſhall at laſt attain to a more comfortable State. All true ſpiritual Comfort as well as Salvation is indeed quite baniſhed out of the World if it be ſuſpended upon the Condition of our good
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96243:86"/>Works, which hath already appeared to be the Condition of the Law that worketh no Comfort but Wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15. This makes the ways of Godlineſs odious to many, they think they ſhall never enjoy a pleaſant hour in this World, if they walk in them, and they had rather comfort themſelves with ſinful Pleaſures then have no Comfort at all. Others labour a while in ſuch a comfortleſs Religion with inward fretting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining at the Bondage of it, and at laſt grow wearry and throw of all Religion, becauſe they know none better. They that bind ſuch heavy burthens upon Men and grievous to be born will plead, that they are not to be blamed becauſe they do but preach the Goſpel of God and Chriſt, whereas indeed they preach a Goſpel of Man's own forging contrary to the nature of the true Goſpel of Chriſt, which is glad tidings of great joy to all People, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10. An uncomfortable Goſpel cannot proceed from God the Father, who is <hi>the Father of Mercies and the God of all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. <hi>Nor from Chriſt who is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of Iſrael,</hi> Luk. 2.25. nor from the <hi>Spirit</hi> who is the <hi>Comforter,</hi> Joh. 14.16, 17. God <hi>meeteth him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 64.5. He will be ſerved with gladneſs and ſinging, as he ſhewed by the Type of variety of Muſick, and great numbers of Muſicians in the Temple, Chriſt ſpeaks to us by his Goſpel, that his joy may abide in us, and that our joy may be full, <hi>Job.</hi> 15.11.

                     <hi>That we may be prepared by the Comforts of the Goſpel to perform ſincerely the Duties of the Law, we muſt get ſome aſſurance of our Salvation in that very Faith whereby Chriſt himſelf is received into our Hearts; Therefore me muſt endeavoar to believe on Chriſt confidently, perſwading and aſſuring our ſelves in the Act of believing, that God freely giveth to us an Intereſt in Chriſt and his Salvation according to his gracious Promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>IT is evident that theſe Comforts of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that are neceſſary to an Holy Practice, cannot be truly received without ſome aſſurance of our Intereſt in Chriſt and his Salvation; for ſome of thoſe Comforts conſiſt in a good Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of our reconciliation with God, and of our future Heavenly Happineſs, and of Strength both to will and to do that which is acceptable to God through Chriſt, as hath been before ſhewed: Hence it will clearly follow, that this aſſurance is very neceſſary to enable us for the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96243:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>Practice of Holineſs, as thoſe Comforts that muſt go before the Duties of the Law in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Cauſe goeth before the Effect, tho' not in any diſtance of time. My preſent work is to ſhew, what this aſſurance is that is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto Holineſs, and which I have here aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we muſt act in that very Faith whereby we receive Chriſt himſelf into our Hearts, even in juſtifying ſaving Faith. This Doctrine ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrange to many that profeſs themſelves Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants a late days, whereas it was formerly high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owned by the chief Proteſtants whom God made uſe of to reſtore the Purity of the Goſpel, and to maintain it againſt the Papiſts for many Years, they commonly taught that Faith was a Perſwaſion or Conſidence of our own Salvation by Chriſt, and that we muſt be ſure to apply Chriſt and his Salvation to our ſelves in believing; And this Doctrine was one of the great Engines whereby they prevailed to overthrow the Popiſh Superſtition, whereto doubtfulneſs of Salvation is one of the principal Pillars. But many of the Succeſſors of thoſe Proteſtants have deſerted them, and left their Writings to be ſhamefully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over by the Papiſts, and this innovation hath been of longer ſtanding amongſt us than ſeveral other parts of our new Divinity, and maintained by thoſe that profeſs to abhor that corrupt Doctrine which the Papiſt have built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch Principles. Modern Divines may think they ſtand upon the Shoulders of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, whoſe Labours they enjoy, and that they can ſee farther than they, as the School-men might have like thoughts of the ancient Fathers;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96243:88"/>but for all this they may not be able to ſee ſo far, if the eyes of their Predeceſſors were better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by the Spirit of God to underſtand the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and why may we not judge that it is ſo in the preſent Caſe? The Eyes of Men in theſe late Years have been blinded in this point of Aſſurance by many falſe Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. They think that becauſe Salvation is not promiſed to us abſolutely, but upon condition of believing on Chriſt for it; therefore we muſt firſt believe directly on Chriſt for our Salvation, and after that we muſt reflect our Minds upon our Faith, and examine it by ſeveral Marks and Signs, eſpecially by the Fruit of ſincere Obedience; and if upon this examination we find out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that it is true ſaving Faith, then and not before we may believe aſſuredly that we in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſhall be ſaved: On this account they ſay that our Salvation is by the direct, and our aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance by the reflect act of Faith, and that many have true Faith, and ſhall be ſaved that never have any aſſurance of their Salvation as long as they live in this World, they find by Scripture and Experience, that many precious Saints of God are frequently troubled with doubtings, whither they ſhall be ſaved, and whither their Faith and Obedience be ſincere, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee aſſurance in themſelves; therefore they conclude that Aſſurance muſt not be accounted abſolutely neceſſary to juſtifying Faith and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, leſt we ſhould make the Hearts of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saints ſad and drive them to deſpair. They account that former Proteſtants were guilty of a manifeſt Abſurdity, in making aſſurance to be
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96243:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Nature and Definition of Saving-Faith, becauſe all that hear the Goſpel are bound to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-Faith, and yet they are not bound abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe that they themſelves ſhall be ſaved, for then many of them would be bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that which is not declared in the Goſpel concerning them in particular, yea that which is a plain lye, becauſe the Goſpel ſheweth that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that are called are not choſen to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and that periſh for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. No wonder if the appearance of ſo great an Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity move many to imagine that Saving-Faith is a truſting or reſting on Chriſt as the only ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient means of Salvation without any aſſurance; or that it is a deſiring and venturing to truſt, or rely upon him in a mere State of Suſpence and Uncertainty concerning our Salvation, or with a probable Opinion or conjectural Hope of it at beſt.</p>
               <p>Another Objection againſt this Doctrine of Aſſurance is, that it deſtroyeth Self-examination, bringeth forth the evil Fruits of Pride and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, as if they knew their places in Heaven already before the Day of Judgment, cauſeth careleſneſs of Duty, carnal Security, all manner of Licentiouſneſs. And this maketh them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend doubtfulneſs of our Salvation, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to maintain in us Humility, Religious Fear, Watchfulneſs, much ſearching and trying our ſpiritual State and Ways, diligence in good Works and all Deyotion.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:96243:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Againſt all thoſe contrary Imaginations, I ſhall endeavour to maintain this ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine of aſſurance, as I have expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Direction; and firſt I ſhall lay down ſome Obſervations for the right underſtanding of it, which will be ſufficient to turn the edge of the ſtrongeſt Objections that can be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Obſerve diligently that the Aſſurance directed unto, is not a Perſwaſion that we have already received Chriſt and his Salvation, or that we have been already brought in to a State of Grace, but only that God is pleaſed graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to give Chriſt and his Salvation unto us, and to bring us into a State of Grace, though we have been altogether in a State of Sin and Death until this preſent time; ſo that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth not at all tend to breed Preſumption in wicked and unregenerate Men, that their ſtate is good already, but only encourageth them to come to Chriſt confidently for a good State. I acknowledge that we may, yea many muſt be taught to doubt whether their preſent State be good; and that it is Humility ſo to do, and that we muſt find out the Certainty and Sincerity of our Faith and Obedience by Self-examination, before we can have a well-grounded Aſſurance that we are in a State of Grace and Salvation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that ſuch an aſſurance belongeth to that which they call the reflect Act of Faith (if any act of Faith can be made of, it being ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sence or feeling of what is in my ſelf) and is not of the Eſſence of that Faith whereby we
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96243:89"/>are juſtified and ſaved, and that many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Saints are without it, and ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doubts that are contrary to it, ſo that they may not know at all that it ſhall go well with them at the Day of Judgment; and that it may be ſometimes intermitted, if not wholly loſt after it is gotten, and that we ſhould ſtrive to walk holily, that we may attain to it; becauſe it is very uſeful for our growth and increaſe in Faith, and in all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> amongſt us, when they ſpeak or write of Aſſurance, mean only, that which is by Reflection, and I have ſaid enough briefly, to ſhew that what I aſſert, is conſiſtent with the Doctrine which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received concerning it, and deſtructive to none of the good Fruits of it, therefore not guilty of thoſe Evils that ſome falſly charge it with. This kind of Aſſurance which I ſpeak of, anſwereth not the Queſtion, Whither I am already in a ſtate of Grace and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? There is another great Queſtion that the Soul muſt anſwer, that it may get into a ſtate of Grace. Whether God be graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed now to beſtow Chriſt and his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon me, though I have been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very wicked Creature? We muſt be ſure to reſolve this Queſtion comfortably, by another kind of Aſſurance in the direct act of Faith, wherein we are to perſwade our ſelves without reflecting upon any good Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our ſelves: That God is ready gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly to receive us into the Arms of his ſaving Mercy in Chriſt, notwithſtanding all
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96243:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>our former Wickedneſs, according to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe, <hi>I will call them my people, which were not my people, and her beloved, which was not beloved, and it ſhall come to paſs, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my people, there ſhall they be called the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the living God,</hi> Rom. 9.25, 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Aſſurance directed unto, is not a Perſwaſion of our Salvation, whatever we do, or however we live and walk; but only in a limited way through meer Free-grace in Chriſt, by partaking of Holineſs as well as Forgiveneſs, and by walking in the way of Holineſs to the Enjoyment of the Glory of God. We ſhall not heartily deſire or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to aſſure our ſelves of ſuch a Salvation as this, if we be not brought firſt to ſee our own Sinfulneſs, and Miſery, and to deſpair of our own Righteouſneſs and Strength, and to hunger and thirſt for the ſanctifying as well as juſtifying Grace of God in Chriſt, that ſo we may walk in the ways of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Enjoyment of Heavenly Glory. The Faith whereby we receive Chriſt muſt have in it not only a Perſwaſion of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but theſe and the like good Qualifications that will make it a moſt holy Faith. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an Aſſurance thus qualified will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get any Pride in us, but rather Humility and ſelf-loathing, except any account it Pride to rejoyce and glory in Chriſt, when we have no Confidence in the Fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. It will not deſtroy religious Fear, and breed
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96243:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>carnal Security; but rather it will make us fear going aſide from Chriſt our only Reſuge and Security, and walking after the Fleſh. <hi>Noah</hi> had cauſe to enter into the Ark, and to abide there with Aſſurance of his Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he might well be afraid to venture out of the Ark, becauſe he was perſwaded that Continuance in the Ark was his only Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from periſhing in the Flood. And how can a Perſwaſion of Salvation in a way of Holineſs, breed Sloathfulneſs in Duty, Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs and Licentiouſneſs? It doth rather mightily allure us and ſtir us up to be always abounding in the Work of the Lord, <hi>for as much as we know that our labour is not in vain in the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.5. They that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Free-grace of God toward them in Chriſt, are not indeed ſollicitous about earning their Salvation by their own legal Works, and Satan is ready to ſuggeſt to them, that this is a ſinful Careleſneſs, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Licenciouſneſs; but they that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this falſe Suggeſtion of Satan, ſhew plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they do not yet know what it is to ſerve God in Love, and that they are held in to all their Obedience by the Bit and Bridle of ſlaviſh Fear, <hi>as the horſe and mule that have no underſtanding,</hi> Pſal. 32.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Beware of thinking ſo highly of this Aſſurance, as if it were inconſiſtent with any doubting in the ſame Soul. A great Reaſon why many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have receded from the Doctrine of their Anceſtors in this Point, is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96243:91"/>becauſe they think, there can be no true Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Salvation in any that are troubled with Doubtings, as they find many be, whom they cannot but own as true Believers and precious Saints of God. True indeed, this Aſſurance muſt be contrary to Doubtings in the nature of it, and ſo if it be perfect in the higheſt Degree it would exclude all Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Soul, and it doth now exclude in ſome Degree. But is there not Fleſh as well as Spirit in the beſt Saints on Earth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Is there not <hi>a law in their members warring againſt the law of their minds?</hi> Rom. 7.23. May not one that truly believeth, ſay, <hi>Lord, help my unbelief,</hi> Mark 9.24. Can any on Earth ſay, they have received any Grace in the higheſt Degree, and that they are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from the contrary Corruption? Why then ſhould we think that Aſſurance cannot be true, except it be perfect, and free the Soul from all Doubtings? The Apoſtle accounts it a great Bleſſing to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that they had much Aſſurance, intimating that ſome true Aſſurance might be in a leſs Degree, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Peter</hi> had ſome good Aſſurance of Chriſt's Help when he walked on the Water at Chriſt's Command, and yet he had ſome Doubtfulneſs in him, as his Fear ſhewed when he ſaw the Wind boiſterous. He had ſome Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to doubting, though it were but little, as Chriſt's Words to him ſhew, <hi>O thou of little faith, wherefore didſt thou doubt?</hi> Matth. 14.29, 30, 31. It is ſtrange if the Fleſh and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhould never oppoſe a true Aſſurance and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96243:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>aſſault it with Doubtings. A Believer may be ſometimes ſo overwhelmed with Doubtings, that he may not be able to perceive an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance in himſelf, he is ſo far from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Place in Heaven already, (as ſome ſcoffingly object) that he will ſay that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not any Aſſurance that he hath of being there, and needeth diligent ſelf-examination to find it out; yet if at that time he can blame his Soul for doubting, <hi>Why art thou cast down, O my ſoul, why art thou diſquieted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me? hope thou in God for I ſhall yet praiſe him,</hi> Pſal. 42.11. If he can condemn his Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as ſinful, and ſay with himſelf, <hi>This is mine infirmity</hi> Pſal. 77.10. Theſe Doubtings are of the Fleſh, and of the Devil; if he ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to call God Father, and complain to him that he doubteth whether he be his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and pray that God will give him the Aſſurance of his Fatherly Love which he is not ſenſible of, and diſpel thoſe Fears and Doubtings: I ſay that ſuch an one hath ſome true Aſſurance, though he muſt ſtrive to grow to a higher Degree; for if he were not perſwaded of the Truth of the Love of God towards him, he could not rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Fears and Doubts concerning it as ſinful, neither could he rationally pray to God as his Father, or that God would aſſure him of that Love that he doth not think to be true.</p>
               <p>Do but grant that it is the Nature of ſaving Faith, thus to reſiſt and ſtruggle with ſlaviſh Fears of Wrath, and doubting of our own
<pb facs="tcp:96243:92"/>Salvation, and you grant in effect, that there is, and muſt be ſomething of Aſſurance of our Salvation in Saving faith, whereby it reſiſteth Doubtings, and you are in effect of the ſame Judgment with me in the Aſſertion, however ſtrange my Expreſſions ſeem to you. If this that I have ſaid concerning our Imperfection in Aſſurance, as well as in other Graces, were well conſidered, this ancient <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine would be freed much from Prejudice, and gain more Eſteem among us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In the laſt place, let it be well obſerved, that the Reaſon why we are to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our ſelves in our Faith, that God freely giveth Chriſt and his Salvation to us particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly is, not becauſe it is a Truth before we believe it, but becauſe it becometh a certain Truth when we believe it, and becauſe it will never be true, except we do in ſome meaſure perſwade and aſſure our ſelves that it is ſo. We have no abſolute Promiſe or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in Scripture, that God certainly will or doth, give Chriſt and his Salvation to any one of us in particular, neither do we know it to be true already by Scripture, or Senſe, or Reaſon, before we aſſure our ſelves abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it, yea, we are without Chriſt's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at preſent in a ſtate of Sin and Miſery under the Curſe and Wrath of God. Only I ſhall prove that we are bound by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, thus to aſſure our ſelves, and the Scripture doth ſufficiently warrant us that we ſhall not deceive our ſelves in believing a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96243:92"/>Lie, but according to our Faith ſo it ſhall be to us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.29. This is a ſtrange kind of Aſſurance far different from other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary kinds, and therefore no Wonder, if it be found weak and imperfect, and difficult to be obtained, and it be aſſaulted with many Doubtings. We are conſtrained to believe other things on the clear Evidence we have that they are true, and would remain true, whether we believe them or no, ſo that we cannot deny our Aſſent without rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Light of our Sences, Reaſon or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but here our Aſſurance is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on our Thoughts by any Evidence of the thing, but we muſt work it out in our ſelves by the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, and thereby we bring our own Thoughts into Captivity to the Obedience of Chriſt. None but God can juſtly require of us this kind of Aſſurance, becauſe he only calleth thoſe things that are not as tho they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. He only can give Exiſtence to things that yet are not, and make a thing to be true upon our believing it, that was not true before. He only can make good that Promiſe, <hi>What things ſoever ye deſire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them,</hi> Mark 11.24. <hi>Who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs, when the Lord command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not,</hi> Lament. 3.37. Therefore this Faith is due to God only, and greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>downdeth to his Glory. Men will often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Believing ſomething like it, as when one ſays, I will forgive your Offence and be
<pb facs="tcp:96243:93"/>your Friend, if I can find that you believe it, and that you take me for a Friend; but their fallible Word is not ſufficient ground to make us perſwade our ſelves abſolutely that we ſhall have their promiſed favour. The Faith of Miracles gives us ſome light in this matter; Chriſt aſſured them on whom they were wrought, and who had Power given them of working them, that the Miracles ſhould be wrought, if they believed without doubting of the Event, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. And there is a Reaſon for this Reſemblance becauſe the end of working Miracles was to confirm the Doctrine of the Goſpel of Salvation by Faith in Chriſt's Name, as the Scriptures clearly ſhew, and indeed the Salvation of a Sinner is a very great Miracle. It is reported that Wizards do often require thoſe that come to them that they ſhould believe that they ſhall obtain what they deſire of them, or at leaſt that they are able to fulfil their Deſires, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Devil, the Maſter of thoſe Wizards ſheweth himſelf to be God's Ape, and that he would fain have that Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry aſcribed to himſelf that is due to God alone.</p>
               <p>Having thus explained the Nature of that Aſſurance which I have directed unto, I ſhall now produce ſeveral Arguments to prove, that there is, and muſt neceſſarily be ſuch an Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Perſwaſion of our Salvation in Saving-Faith it ſelf.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:96243:93"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> This Aſſurance of Salvation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the Deſcription before given of that Faith whereby we receive Chriſt and his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation into our Hearts. I deſcribed Faith to be a Grace of the Spirit, whereby we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the Goſpel, and alſo believe on Chriſt as he is revealed and freely promiſed to us therein for all his Salvation, and I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Explanation, that believing on Chriſt, is the ſame with reſting, relying, leaning, ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves on Chriſt, or God through Chriſt, for our Salvation. It may be ſome will like that Deſcription the better, becauſe Faith was there deſcribed by Terms that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily uſed, even by thoſe that deny the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Aſſurance; but thoſe ordinary Terms do ſufficiently include Aſſurance in the nature of Faith, and they cannot ſtand without it, and this ſheweth that many hold the Doctrine of Aſſurance implicitly, and profeſs it, though they think the contrary. Believing on Chriſt for Salvation as freely promiſed to us, muſt needs include a Dependance on Chriſt with a Perſwaſion, that Salvation ſhall be freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as it is freely promiſed to us. Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a divine Faith grounded on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Truth of the Free-promiſe, if it did not in ſome meaſure exclude a mere Suſpence and wavering Opinion or Conjecture, were not worthy to be ſo called. Some may be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as to ſay, that Faith is only a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we ſhall be ſaved by Chriſt if we perform ſuch Conditions as he requireth, and
<pb facs="tcp:96243:94"/>then indeed it will leave us where it found us as to any certainty of Salvation until thoſe Conditions be performed; but I have already prevented ſuch an Abſurdity, by ſhewing that this believing on Chriſt, is it ſelf not only the Condition of our Salvation, but alſo the Inſtrument whereby we actually receive it. Believing being the proper Act of Faith, muſt needs have the ſame contraries to it, as <hi>ſtaggering,</hi> Rom. 4.20. <hi>Wavering,</hi> Heb. 10.29. <hi>Doubting,</hi> Matth. 14.31. <hi>Fear,</hi> Mark 5.36. Theſe contraries do much illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the nature of Faith, and do ſhew that believing muſt have ſome Confidence in it, elſe it would have doubting in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it: for what Man that underſtandeth the Preciouſneſs of his immortal Soul, and his Danger of looſing it, can ever avoid Fear, Doubting and Trouble of Heart, by any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving whereby he doth not at all aſſure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his Salvation? The other Terms of truſting and reſting on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Faith is often deſcribed by orthodox Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, muſt include Aſſurance of Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſignifie the ſame thing with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on Chriſt; the Soul muſt have its ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Support to beat it up againſt Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fears, Troubles, Cares, Deſpair, that it may thus truſt and reſt. The right manner of truſting and hoping in the Lord is by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring our ſelves againſt all Fears and Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>That the Lord is our God, and he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Salvation. I trusted on thee, O Lord, I ſaid thou art my God,</hi> Pſal. 31.14. <hi>The Lord
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:96243:94"/>is my rock, and my fortreſs, and my deliverer, my ſtrength, in whom I will trust,</hi> Pſal. 18.2. <hi>Behold, God is my ſalvation, I will trust and not be afraid,</hi> Iſa. 12.2. <hi>O my ſoul hope thou in God, who is the health of my countenance and my God,</hi> Pſal. 42.16. <hi>True hope is grounded on God only, that he will bleſs us,</hi> that it <hi>may be an anchor for the ſoul, ſure and ſtedfast,</hi> Heb. 6.17.18, 19. If you truſt, relie, and ſtay your ſelves on Chriſt, or hope in him, without aſſuring your ſelves at all of Salvation by him, you make no better uſe of him, than if he were a broken reed; and if you would ſtay your ſelves on the Lord, you muſt look on him as your God, as the Prophet teacheth, <hi>Let him trust in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God,</hi> Iſai. 50. 10. If you will reſt in the Lord you muſt believe that he dealeth bountifully with you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.7. or elſe for ought you know you make your Bed in Hell; and you will ſhew little regard of Chriſt and of your own Soul, if you dare to reſt under the Wrath of God without any Perſwaſion of a ſure Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt. People may pleaſe themſelves with ſuch a truſting or reſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when they are at eaſe, but in time of Temptation it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth away, and appeareth to be no true Faith, but is turned into Shame. The Soul that liveth in ſuch wavering and doubting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation, doth not ſtay it ſelf nor reſt at all, but is like a Wave of the Sea driven with the Wind, and toſſed, he <hi>is a double minded man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in all his ways,</hi> Jam. 1.6. If you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in meer Suſpence and Doubtfulneſs of
<pb facs="tcp:96243:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>Salvation by Chriſt; your Deſire to truſt, is but a lazy woulding without any fixed Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and you dare not yet venture to truſt on him ſtedfaſtly. If you call it only your deſire to truſt and relie on Jeſus Chriſt, I may anſwer that you cannot do thus much in a right manner except you deſire and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to perſwade and aſſure your ſelves of your Salvation by Chriſt, notwithſtanding all the Cauſes that you have to doubt and fear the contrary. If it be objected that we may truſt on Chriſt only as a ſufficient means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, without any Aſſurance of the Effect. I ſhall acknowledge that the ſufficiency of God and Chriſt is a good ground for us to reſt on, but we muſt underſtand by it, not only a ſufficiency of Power, but alſo of Good-will and Mercy towards us: For what have we to do more with the Sufficiency of God's and Chriſt's Power than fallen Angels, without his Good-will towards us? and if this be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed, it will exclude Doubtfulneſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Several places of Scripture declare poſitively and expreſly, that we are to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of our Salvation in that Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are juſtified and ſaved. I ſhall produce ſome Inſtances. We are exhorted, <hi>to draw near to God with full aſſurance of faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. Many apply this Text to that which they call, the reflect Act of Faith, becauſe they imagine that all Aſſurance muſt needs be by Reflection; but the Words of the Text do
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96243:95"/>clearly teach us to underſtand it of that Act of Faith, whereby we draw near to God, that is the direct Act, and it is that very Faith whereby the Juſt do live, even juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaving Faith, <hi>verſe</hi> 38. And this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance muſt be full, at leaſt in the true and proper Nature of it, in Oppoſition unto mere Doubtfulneſs and Uncertainty, though we are yet further to labour for that which is full in the higheſt Degree of Perfection. And the ſame Faith whereby we are exhorted to draw nigh unto God, and whereby the Juſt liveth, is a little after, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1. affirmed to be <hi>the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Why ſhould ſaving Faith have theſe high Titles and Attributes given to it, if it did not contain in it a ſure Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the great things of our Salvation hoped for, which maketh them to be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Eyes of our Mind, as if they were already preſent in their Subſtance, though yet not viſible to our bodily Eyes; that Faith whereby we are made Partakers of Chriſt, and to be Chriſt's Houſe, muſt be worthy to be called Confidence, and accompanied with reioycing Hope, <hi>Whoſe houſe are we if we hold fast the confidence and rejoycing of the hope, firm unto the end,</hi> Heb. 3.6.14. What is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence concerning any thing, but truſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it with a firm Perſwaſion of the Truth of it? If we have only a ſtrong Opinion concerning a thing, without any abſolute cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, we uſe to ſay that we are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether confident of it. The Faith whereby
<pb facs="tcp:96243:96"/>we are juſtified, muſt be in a meaſure like to the Faith whereby <hi>Abraham</hi> againſt Hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in Hope, that his Seed ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; be multiplyed according to the Promiſe of God, though by reaſon of the Deadneſs of his own Body; and of <hi>Sarah</hi>'s Womb, he could have no Evidence from his own Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to aſſure himſelf of it, but all Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were rather to the contrary, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teacheth clearly <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 19, 23.24. As abſolute as this Promiſe was thus made <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet it was not to be fulfilled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Aſſurance of Faith, and by the like Faith the free Promiſes of Salvation by Chriſt, will be abſolutely fulfilled to us. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> expreſly requireth that we ſhould ask good things of God in Faith, nothing doubting, which includeth Aſſurance manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and he telleth us plainly, that without it a Man ought not to think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord; therefore we may firmly conclude, that without it we ſhall not receive the Salvation of Chriſt, <hi>James</hi> 1.6. 7. And that which the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth us not to doubt of is, the obtaining the things that we ask, as we may learn from an Inſtruction to the ſame purpoſe given to us by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>What things ſoever ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye ſhall have them,</hi> Mark 11.24. More pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture might be alledged to the ſame purpoſe; but theſe are ſufficient to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that we are bound to aſſure our ſelves of our Salvation in Faith it ſelf, or elſe we
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96243:96"/>are never likely to enjoy it, and that it is not Humility, but rather proud Diſobedience to live in a ſtate of mere Suſpenſe and Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs concerning our Salvation; and that this Aſſurance muſt be in the direct Act of Faith whereby we are juſtified and ſaved: For as for that which is called the Reflect Act of Faith, it is a certain Truth and generally owned, that it is not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation to any, and that it is ſinful and pernicious to many to believe that they are already entred into a ſtate of Grace and Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God giveth us ſufficient ground in Scripture to come to Chriſt with confident Faith, at the very firſt, truſting aſſuredly that Chriſt and his Salvation ſhall be given to us without any Failing and Delay, however vile and ſinful our Condition hath been hitherto. The Scripture ſpeaketh to the vileſt Sinners in ſuch a manner as if it were framed on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to beget Aſſurance of Salvation in them immediately, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.26. This Promiſe is unverſal, That whoſoever believeth on Chriſt ſhall not be aſhamed, without making a Difference between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Greek, Rom.</hi> 10.11, 12. And this Promiſe is confirmed by the Blood of Chriſt, who was given for the World, and lifted up upon the Croſs for this very end, that <hi>whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life,</hi> John 3.14, 15, 16. His Invitation is free to any, <hi>If any man thirst, let him come to me and drink,</hi> and this Drink is promiſed to every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, <hi>John</hi> 7.37. 39. The Command of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb facs="tcp:96243:97"/>is propounded not only in general, but in particular, and the Promiſe of Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on believing, is alſo applyed perſonally, and that to ſuch as have been hitherto in a ſtate of Sin and Wrath; as to the wicked perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſelf-murdering Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thine houſe.</hi> God commanded them that walked altogether in Sin hitherto, to call him their own Father in their very firſt returning, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4. So <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.23. God ſaith, he will ſay, <hi>Thou art my people, and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God,</hi> confidently averring their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Intereſt in him. God hath joyned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and Salvation inſeparably together, <hi>In returning and rest ye ſhall be ſaved, in quietneſs and in confidence ſhall be your ſtrength, Iſai.</hi> 30.15. What a poor ſlender Uſe and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment do many make of theſe Diſcoveries of the rich Grace of God towards Sinners, who ſay that if we ſee that we have performed the Condition of believing, then we may take Chriſt confidently as our own; they skip over the firſt and principal Uſe they ought to make of them; the very Performance of the Condition is to take Chriſt as our own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and to eat him and drink him, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving conſiently on him for our Salvation. If an honeſt rich Man ſay to a poor Woman, I promiſe to be thy Husband if thou wilt have me, ſay but the Word and I am thine; may not ſhe preſently anſwer confidently, Then thou art my Husband and I claim thee for my Husband; and ſhould ſhe not rather ſay ſo, then
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96243:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſay, I believe not what thou ſayeſt. If an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man ſay, Do but take this Gift and it is your own, do but eat and drink and you are freely welcome, may not I take the Gift, and eat and drink at firſt without any further ado, and with Aſſurance that it is mine freely; if I do it doubtingly, I diſparage the Honeſty and Credit of the Donor, as if he were not a Man of his Word. In like manner, if, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be too confident, leaſt we ſhould believe a lie, we ſhould come to Chriſt doubtingly, and in mere Suſpenſe, whether we ſhall be freely entertained after all Gods free Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Promiſes, ſhould we not diſparage the Faithfulneſs of God? and ſhould we not be guilty of making God a Liar? as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John</hi> teacheth, becauſe of our not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Record which God gave of his Son, <hi>and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his Son,</hi> 1 John 5.10, 11. And what if the Salvation pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed be not abſolutely intended for all to whom the Goſpel cometh? it is enough that God giveth us his faithful Word, that they that believe, ſhall have it, and none elſe, and hath abſolutely intended to fulfill his Word, that none ſhall find it to be a lie to them, and hath joyned Believing and Salvation toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſeparably. On this ground God may juſtly cauſe the Promiſe of this Salvation to be publiſhed to all, and may juſtly require all to believe on him aſſuredly for their own Salvation, that ſo it may appear whether they will give him the Glory of his Truth, and
<pb facs="tcp:96243:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>if they will not, he may juſtly reject them, and puniſh them ſeverely for diſhonouring him by their Unbelief: in this Caſe we muſt not look to the ſecret Decrees of God, but to his revealed Promiſes and Command. Thus God promiſed to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he would give them the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and would fight for them againſt their Enemies, and required them not to fear or be diſcouraged, that ſo the Promiſe might be fulfilled to them, yet God never abſolutely decreed or intended that thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould enter in, as the Event did quickly manifeſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.20, 21, 29.30. Yet were they not bound in this caſe to truſt confidently in God to give them Victory over their Enemies, and to give them the Poſſeſſion of the Land? had they not ſufficient ground for ſuch a Faith? was it not juſt with God to conſume them in the Wilderneſs for their Unbelief? Let us therefore fear, leaſt a Promiſe being made of entring into this everlaſting Reſt through Chriſt, we ſhould come ſhort of it, and fall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame Example of Unbelief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Profeſſors of true Godlineſs that we read of through the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament did commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their Aſſurance and Perſwaſion of their Intereſt in God and his Salvation, and were directed by the word of God ſo to do, and true Saints had ſtill ſome true Aſſurance of it, and we have no cauſe to judge that this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96243:98"/>Aſſurance was grounded on the certainty of their own good Qualifications, but rather on the Promiſes of God by the direct. Act of Faith. We may judge of the ordinary Profeſſion of the Frame of Spirit that was in Saints, by ſome Inſtances. I ſhall begin with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that the Church made when it was very corrupt, at its firſt coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> when few of them could aſſure themſelves by their own good Qualifications that they were in a ſtate of Grace already, which many now imagine to be the only way of Aſſurance. Even in that corrupt Time the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſung that triuphant Song of <hi>Moſes, The Lord is my ſtrength and my ſong, and he is become my ſalvation, he is my God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Moſes</hi> taught them in this Song to aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their own perſonal Intereſt in the Salvation, and he guided them to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of their Duty, and they did not find fault with <hi>Moſes</hi> as ſome do with Miniſters in theſe Days, for putting them to expreſs more Confidence in their Song than they could find ground for in their Qualifications, but they applied themſelves to the exerciſe of their Faith agreeably to the Song, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this Faith was unfeigned in ſome ſew of them, though but feigned in others, for it is teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, that then they believed his Words they ſang his Praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.12. Several other Pſalms and Songs that were by divine Appointment in common Uſe under the Old Teſtament, are as clear an Evidence as we can deſire of that Aſſurance of Faith that
<pb facs="tcp:96243:99"/>was commonly profeſſed, and that People were generally bound to, under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. &amp; 27. &amp; 46. Many other Pſalms or Expreſſions in Pſalms might be alledged. The Spirits of few in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, could have throughly complyed with ſuch Pſalms though they were true Believers, if all the Aſſurance of the Love of God muſt altogether depend upon the certain Knowledge of the ſincerity of their own Hearts. We have a great Cloud of Witneſſes gathered out of the whole Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. who did, and ſuffered, and obtained great things by Faith, whoſe Examples are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on purpoſe that we may follow them in believing to the ſaving of our Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. And if we conſider theſe Examples particularly, we ſhall find that many of them do evidently guide us to ſuch a ſaving Faith, as hath an Aſſurance of the Effect contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the nature of it. I confeſs we read ſeveral times of the Fears and Doubtings of the Saints under the Old Teſtament; but we read alſo how their Faith oppoſed ſuch Fears and Doubts, and how they themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them as contrary to Faith, as in the Pſalms, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. &amp; 77.7, 10. The moſt mournful Pſalm in Scripture begins with an Expreſſion of ſome Aſſurance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.1. And we may note that the Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that we meet with of the Saints of old, were commonly occaſioned by ſome Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Affliction, or ſome hainous Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not by common Failings, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96243:99"/>Original Depravation of Nature, or the Uncertainty of their Election, or any Thought that it is Humility to doubt, and that they were not bound to be confident of Gods Salvation, becauſe then many might be bound to believe a Lie. It is hard to find any of theſe Occaſions of doubting under the Old Teſtament, though they are grown ſo riſe amongſt us now under the New Teſtament. In the time of the Apoſtles we may well expect that the Aſſurance of Faith grew high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, becauſe the Salvation of Chriſt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and the Spirit of Adoption poured forth plentifully, and the Church made free from its former Bondage under the terrifying Legal Covenant. <hi>Paul</hi> could prove to primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians, by Appeals to their own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that they were the Children and Heirs of God, becauſe they had not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Spirit of Bondage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption, whereby they <hi>cry, Abba, father, the Spirit it ſelf bearing witneſs with our ſpirits</hi> (or <hi>beareth our ſpirits witneſs</hi> as the <hi>Syriaok</hi> and vulgar <hi>Latin</hi> render it, and as the like <hi>Greek</hi> Phraſe is rendred, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1.) <hi>That we are the children of God, and if children, then heirs,</hi> Rom. 8.15, 16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. And the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Epheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that after they believed, they were ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Holy Spirit, which was the Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their Inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13, 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> They were ſealed from the ſame time that they believed, for the original Words are in the ſame Tenſe. If this Witneſs, Seal and Earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb facs="tcp:96243:100"/>of the Spirit had not been Ordinary to Believers, it would not have been ſufficient to prove that they were the Children of God, and ſuch manner of arguing might have dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſome to deſpair, that wanted this Witneſs, Seal and Earneſt. Let us enquire now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spirit beareth witneſs that we are the Children of God, and enables us to cry Abba, Father, by the direct Act, or by that which they call the Reflect Act of Faith; for we muſt not think that it is done by an Enthuſiaſm, without any ordinary means; nor can we reaſonably imagine, that no true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers can call God Father, by the Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Spirit, but only thoſe few that are ſo ſure of their own Sincerity, that by reflecting upon it, they can ground an Act of Faith concerning their own Intereſt in Chriſt; no ſurely, therefore we may judge rather that the Spirit worketh this in us by giving us ſaving Faith it ſelf, whereby all true Believers are enabled to truſt aſſuredly on Chriſt for the Enjoyment of the Adoption of Children and all his Salvation, according to the Free Promiſe of God, and to call God Father, without reflecting on any good Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications in our ſelves, and by the direct Act of it: For the Spirit is received by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Act of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. And ſo he is the Spirit of Adoption, and Comfort to all that receive him. They that aſſert that the Spirit witneſſeth our Adoption, only by aſſuring us of the Sincerity of our Faith, Love, and other gracious Qualifications, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96243:100"/>Act of Faith, do teach alſo commonly, that you muſt again try whether the Spirit thus witneſſing, be the Spirit of Truth, or of Deluſion, by ſearching narrowly whether our inward Grace be ſincere or counterfeit, ſo that hereby the Teſtimony of the Spirit is rendred ſo hard to be diſcerned, that it ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us in no ſtead, but all our Aſſurance is made at laſt to depend on our own certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our own Sincerity. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Evidences to ſhew, That Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers generally were perſwaded of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Apoſtles times, they loved and waited for the coming of Chriſt to judge the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.7. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. They lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the Saints for the Hope that was laid up for them in Heaven, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.3, 4. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> that were very carnal, and but Babes in Chriſt, were perſwaded that they ſhould judge the World, and Angels, and that their Bodies were Members of Chriſt, and the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 3, 15, 19. The very firſt coming of the Goſpel to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> was in the Holy Ghoſt, and much Aſſurance, ſo that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it with much Affliction with Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, when as yet they had no Conſiderable time to get Aſſurance, by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on their good Qualifications, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.5, 6. Likewiſe the believing <hi>Hebrews</hi> when they were illuminated at their firſt Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods, knowing that they had in Heaven, a better and more enduring Subſtance, and this was
<pb facs="tcp:96243:101"/>their Confidence, which they were not to caſt off, becauſe the Juſt liveth by Faith, and therefore it appeareth that this Confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed neceſſarily to juſtifying, ſaving Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 32, 34, 35, 38. Now let thoſe that alledge the Examples or Experiences of many modern Chriſtians to diſprove all that I have aſſerted, and conſider well whether theſe are fit to be laid in the Ballance againſt all the Scripture Examples and Experiences that I have produced out of the Old and New Teſtament. I confeſs that Aſſurance of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is more rarely profeſſed by Chriſtians in theſe times than formerly, and we may thank ſome Teachers for it, that have deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Doctrine of former <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in this Point, and vented againſt it ſeveral Errors, ſuch as have been already named, and now would take Advantage to confirm the Truth of their Doctrines from thoſe Doubtings in Chriſtians, that have been chiefly occaſioned by it. But however the nature of ſaving Faith is ſtill the ſame, and I aſſert that in theſe Days as well as formerly, it always hath in it ſome Aſſurance of Salvation by Chriſt, which doth and will appear, at leaſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting and condemning all Doubtings, and praying againſt them, and endeavouring to truſt aſſuredly, and to call God Father, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in extraordinary Deſertions, by which our Gaſe muſt not be tried. We are not to truſt the Judgment of many concerning themſelves, they will judge falſly, that they have no Aſſurance at all, becauſe they know
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96243:101"/>not yet by Marks and Signs that they are in a ſtate of Grace already, or becauſe they think that there is no Aſſurance when there are many Doubtings, and becauſe it is ſo weak and ſo much oppreſſed with Doubting, that it can hardly be diſcerned, as Life in a fainting Fit; but if their Judgments be better informed, they may be brought to diſcern ſome Aſſurance in themſelves: We are alſo to take heed of miſtaking thoſe for true Believers that are not ſo, and of judging this Point by their Experiences, which is a vulgar Error. The blind Charity of ſome moveth them to take all for true Believers, which are full of Doubts and Troubles concerning their Salvation, though it may be they only be convinced of Sin, and brought to ſome Zeal of God that is not according to the Knowledge of the way of Salvation by Chriſt, and they think it Duty to comfort ſuch Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by perſwading of them that their ſtate is good, and their Faith right, though they have no Aſſurance of Salvation. Thus they are brought to judge falſly concerning the nature of Faith, out of their blind Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſuch as are yet in Ignorance and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, and inſtead of comforting ſuch, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take the direct way to harden them in their natural ſtate, and to divert them from ſeeking Conſolation by Saving Faith in Chriſt, and to ruine their Souls for ever.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96243:102"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The chief Office of this Faith in its direct ſaving Act, is to receive Chriſt and his Salvation actually into our Hearts, as hath been proved, which Office cannot be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally performed, except we do in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure perſwade our Hearts, and aſſure our ſelves of the Enjoyment of him, as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy receiveth things into it ſelf by the Hands and Mouth: So the Soul receiveth theſe things to it ſelf, and layeth actual Hold on them by the Faculty of the Will, making choice of them and embracing them in a way of preſent Enjoyment and Poſſeſſion, as it doth by the Faculty of the Underſtanding ſee and apprehend them; thus the Soul receiveth Comfort from outward things. As a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon cannot receive inward Comfort from outward things, as from worldly Eſtate, Wife, Husband, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except it chuſe them as good and count them his own by a Right and Title. This is the only ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way whereby the Soul can actively lay hold on Chriſt, and take actual Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him and his Salvation, as he is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered and promiſed to us in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, by the Grace of Faith, which God hath appointed to be our great Inſtrument for the receiving of him, and cloſing with him. If we do not make choice of Chriſt as our only Salvation, and Happineſs, or if we be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a ſlate of Suſpence, and doubting whether God will be pleaſed to give Chriſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96243:102"/>to us or no, it is evident that our Souls are quite looſe from Chriſt, and have no Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt or Enjoyment of him. They do not ſo much as pretend to any actual receiving or laying hold or chooſing of him, neither are they fully ſatisfied that it is lawful for them ſo to do, but rather they are yet to ſeek whether they have any good Ground and Right to lay hold on him or no. Let any rational; Man judge, whether the Soul doth, or can put forth any ſufficient Act for the Reception and Enjoyment of Chriſt as our Saviour, Head, or Husband, while it is yet in Doubt, whether it be the Will of Chriſt to be joyned with us in ſuch a near Relation; can a Woman honeſtly receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one as her Husband without being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he is fully willing to be her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? The ſame may be ſaid concerning the ſeveral Parts of Chriſt's Salvation which are to be received by Faith. It is evident that we do not aright receive the Benefit of Remiſſion of Sins, for the purging of our Conſciences from that Guilt that lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, unleſs we have an aſſured Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of God's forgiving them; we do not actually receive into our Hearts our Reconciliation with God, and Adoption of Children, and the Title to an everlaſting Inheritance, until we can aſſure our ſelves that God is graciouſly pleaſed to be our God and Father, and take us to be his Children and Heirs. We do not actually receive any
<pb facs="tcp:96243:103"/>ſufficient Strength to encourage our Hearts to Holineſs in all Difficulties, until we can ſtedfaſtly believe that God is with us, and will not fail nor forſake us.</p>
               <p>Hence then we may firmly conclude, that whoſo ſeeketh to be ſaved by Faith, and doth not ſeek to have Aſſurance or Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own Salvation doth but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf, and delude his Soul with a mere Fanſie inſtead of ſaving Faith, and doth in effect ſeek to be ſaved in his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Natural ſtate, without receiving and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actual hold of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is alſo a great and neceſſary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Saving Faith, to purifie the Heart, and to enable us to live and walk in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all holy Duties, by the Grace of Chriſt, and by Chriſt himſelf living in us, as hath been ſhewed before, which Office Faith is not able to perform, except ſome Aſſurance of our own Intereſt in Chriſt and his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation be comprehended in the nature of it. If we would live to God, not our ſelves, but by Chriſt living in us, according to <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Example, we muſt be able to aſſure our ſelves as he did, <hi>Chriſt loved me and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. We are taught, that <hi>if we live in the Spirit, we ſhall walk in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Gal. 5.25. It would be high Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption if we ſhould endeavour to walk above our natural Strength and Power by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:96243:103"/>before we have made ſure of our living by the Spirit. I have ſhewed that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make Uſe of the comfortable Benefits of the Saving Grace of Chriſt, whereby the Goſpel doth engage and encourage us to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Practice, except we have ſome Confidence of our own Intereſt in thoſe ſaving Benefits. If we do not aſſuredly believe that we are dead to Sin, and alive to God through Chriſt, and riſen with Chriſt, and not under the Law, but under Grace, and Members of Chriſt's Body, the Temple of his Spirit, the dear Children of God, it would be Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie to ſerve God upon the Account of ſuch Priviledges as if we reckoned our ſelves to be Partakers of them; he that thinks he ſhould doubt of his Salvation is not a fit Diſciple for this manner of Doctrine, and he may reply to the Preachers of the Goſpel, if you would bring me to Holineſs, you muſt make Uſe of other more eſſectual Arguments, for I cannot practice upon theſe Principles, becauſe I have not Faith enough to believe that I have any Intereſt in them: ſome Arguments taken from the Juſtice and Wrath of God againſt Sinners, and his Mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that perform the Condition of ſincere Obedience, would work more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon me. O what a miſerable worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs kind of ſaving Faith is this? that cannot fit a Believer to practice in a Goſpel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon the moſt pure and powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Grace, but rather leaveth him to
<pb facs="tcp:96243:104"/>work upon Legal Principles, which can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bring him to ſerve God acceptably out of Love, and as ſuch a Faith faileth whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the right manner of obeying upon Goſpel Principles, ſo it faileth alſo in the very matter of ſome great Duties, which are of ſuch a nature that they include Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God's Love in the right Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of them, ſuch are thoſe great Duties of Peace with God, rejoycing in the Lord always, Hope that maketh not aſhamed, own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord as our God and our Saviour, praying to him as our Father in Heaven, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up Body and Soul as an acceptable Sacrifice to him, caſting all our Cares of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul upon him, Contentment and hearty Thankſgiving in every Condition, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our Boaſt in the Lord, triumphing in his Praiſe, rejoycing in Tribulation, putting on Chriſt in our Baptiſm, receiving Chriſt's Body as broken for us, and his Blood as ſhed for us in the Lord's Supper, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Souls willingly to God as our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer when ever he ſhall be pleaſed to call for us, loving Chriſt's Second Appearance, and looking for it as that bleſſed Hope: when we fall into any ſudden Doubting whether we are in a ſtate of Grace already when we are called to any preſent Undertaking, as to partake of the Lord's Supper, or any Duty that requires Aſſurance, to the right Performance of chem; we muſt relieve our ſelves by truſting confidently in Chriſt for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96243:104"/>the preſent Gift of his Salvation, or elſe we ſhall be driven to omit the Duty, or not to perform it rightly or ſincerely; can we judge our ſelves already in a ſtate of Grace by the reflect Act of Faith, if we do not find that we perform theſe Duties, at leaſt ſeveral of them ſincerely, or if we do not find that we have ſuch a holy Faith as doth enable or incline us to the Performance of them? And can we be thus enabled and inclined by any Faith that is without ſome true Aſſurance of our Salvation? Therefore I conclude, that we muſt neceſſarily have ſome Aſſurance of our Salvation in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Act of Faith, whereby we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſanctified, and ſaved, before we can upon any good ground aſſure our ſelves that we are already in a ſtate of Salvation by that which they call the Reflect Act. Give me ſuch a ſaving Faith as will produce ſuch Fruits as theſe. No other Faith will work by Love, and therefore will not avail to Salvation in Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> putteth thee upon ſhewing thy Faith by thy Works, <hi>James</hi> 2.18. And in this Trial this Faith of Aſſurance cometh off with high Praiſe and Honour: When God calleth his People to work outward Miracles by it, all things have been poſſible to them, and it hath frequently brought forth ſuch Works of Righteouſneſs, as may be deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed great Spiritual Miracles; from hence hath proceeded that Heroick Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb facs="tcp:96243:105"/>of the People of God, whereby their abſolute Obedience to God hath ſhined forth in doing and ſuffering thoſe great things which are recorded in the holy Scriptures and in the Hiſtories of the Church. And if we be ever called to the fiery Trial as <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> formerly were, we ſhall find their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Aſſurance, to encourage us in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the ſake of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The contrary Doctrine which excludeth Aſſurance out of the Nature of Saving Faith bringeth forth many evil Fruits; it tendeth to bereave our Souls of all Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Salvation and ſolid Comfort which is the Life of Religion, by placing it after ſincere univerſal Obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we have them not firſt, we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to this Obedience and to any Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that dependeth on it, as hath been proved, and this as far as it prevails makes us ſubject to continual Doubtings concerning our Salvation, and to tormenting Fears of Wrath, which caſteth out true Love to God, and can produce no better than ſlaviſh hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical Service. It is one of the principal Pillars whereby manifold Superſtitions in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery are ſupported, as their Monkiſh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, their Satisfactions for Sin by Works, of Penance, Bodily Macerations, Whippings, Pilgrimages, Indulgences, truſting on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When once Men have loſt the Knowledge of the right way to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:96243:105"/>themſelves of Salvation, they will catch at any Straw to avoid Drowning in the Gulph of Deſpair.</p>
               <p>There is no way to adminiſter any ſolid Comfort to the wounded Spirits of thoſe that ſee themſelves void of all Holineſs, under the Wrath and Curſe of God, dead in Sin, not able ſo much as to think a good Thought; you do but increaſe their Terror and Anguiſh if you tell them they muſt firſt get Faith and Obedience, and when they find they have done that, they may perſwade themſelves, that God will receive them into his Grace and Favour. Alaſs they know that they cannot believe nor obey, except God prevent them with his Grace and Favour, and what if they be even at the Point of Death, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Death's Pangs, ſo that they have no time or leiſure to get good Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and examine the Goodneſs of them, you muſt have a more ſpeedy way to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort ſuch by diſcovering to them the Free-Promiſes of Salvation to the worſt of Sinners by Faith in Chriſt, and by exhorting them to apply thoſe Promiſes and truſt on Chriſt confidently for Remiſſion of Sins, Holineſs and Glory, aſſuring them alſo that God will help them to believe ſincerely on Chriſt, if they deſire it with all their Hearts, and that it is their Duty to believe, becauſe God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96243:106"/>
               <p>Several other Evils are occaſioned by the ſame Doctrine, Men are unwilling to know the worſt of themſelves, and prone to think their Qualifications better than they are, that they may avoid Deſpair; others pleaſe and content themſelves without any Aſſurance of their Intereſt in Chriſt, becauſe they think that is not neceſſary to Salvation, and that but few attain to it, and in this they ſhew little Love to Chriſt, or to their own Souls, ſome foſter Doubtings of Salvation as Signs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, though they will hypocritically com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of them; many miſpend their time in poring upon their own Hearts, to find out ſome Evidence of their Intereſt in Chriſt, when they ſhould rather be imployed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt, and walking in him by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident Faith.</p>
               <p>Some are troubled with Doubts whether they ſhould call God Father, and what Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions they ſhould have of him in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and are offended at Miniſters, that in their Publick Prayers uſe any Expreſſions that the People cannot joyn in, as if they do own God as their God and Father, and Chriſt as their Saviour; and upon the ſame Account they are offended at the Publick ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many of <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms, and avoid partaking of the Lord's Supper, becauſe they are not ſatisfied about their Intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96243:106"/>
               <p>Though true Believers have ſome Aſſurance of Salvation in Saving Faith it ſelf, yet it is much weakned in many by this contrary Doctrine, and aſſaulted with many Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and then other good Qualifications muſt needs be low and weak together with it, and ſo obſcure that it is very hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them; how hard a thing then will it be for true Believers to aſſure themſelves, by the certain Knowledge of their own Sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they are in a ſtate of Grace already, which is the only Aſſurance of Faith? Some preſcribe Marks and Signs to diſtinguiſh Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity from Hypocriſie, that Believers cannot ſufficiently try themſelves by them, except they have more Knowledge and Experience than Ordinary.</p>
               <p>Thus many Believers walk heavily in the Bitterneſs of their Souls, conflicting with Fears and Doubtings all their Days, and this is the Cauſe that they have ſo little Courage and Fervency of Spirit in the ways of God, and that they ſo much mind earthly things, and are ſo afraid of Sufferings and Death. And if they get ſome Aſſurance by the Reflect Act of Faith, they often ſoon loſe it again by Sins and Temptations. The way to avoid theſe Evils is to get your Aſſurance, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and renew it upon all Occaſions by the direct Act of Faith, by truſting aſſuredly on the Name of the Lord, and ſtaying your
<pb facs="tcp:96243:107"/>ſelf upon your God, when you walk in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſee no light in any of your own Qualifications, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. I doubt not but the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of many choice Chriſtians will bear witneſs to this Truth.</p>

               <p>HAving already diſcovered to you the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and effectual means of an holy practice, my remaining work is to lead you to the actual Exerciſe and Improvement of them, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate attainment of the End; and I think it may be clearly perceived by the foregoing Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That Faith in Chriſt is the Duty with which a holy Life is to begin, and by which the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other holy Duties is laid in the Soul. It is before ſufficiently proved, That Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with all Endowments neceſſary to enable us to an holy practice, is received actually into our hearts by Faith. This is the uniting Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Spirit of God knitteth the knot of myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Marriage betwixt Chriſt and us, and maketh us Branches of that noble Vine, Members of that Body joyned to that excellent Head, living Stones
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:96243:108"/>of the ſpiritual Temple, built upon the precious living Corner-ſtone and ſure Foundation, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Bread and Drink that came down from Heaven and giveth Life to the World. This is the Grace whereby we paſs from our corrupt natural State, to a new holy State in Chriſt, alſo from Death in Sin to Life in Righteouſneſs, and whereby we are comforted, that ſo we may be eſtabliſhed in every good Word and Work. If we put the Queſtion, what muſt we do that we may work the works of God? Chriſt reſolveth it, That we <hi>believe on him whom he hath ſent,</hi> Joh. 6.28, 29. He putteth us firſt upon the work of believing, which is the work of God by way of eminence, the work of works, becauſe all other good works proceed from it. The ſcope of the preſent Direction, is to put you upon the performance of this great work of believing on Chriſt, and to guide you therein; for which end, you are to conſider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, four things contained in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, you are to make it your diligent endeavour to perform the great work of Believing on Chriſt. Many make little Conſcience of this Duty. It is not known by Natural Light, as many moral Duties are, but only by ſupernatural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in the Goſpel, and it is fooliſhneſs to the natural Man. Theſe are ſometimes terrified with apprehenſions of other ſins, and will examine themſelves concerning them; and it may be, will write them down to help their Memories and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; but the great ſin of not believing on Chriſt, is ſeldom thought of in their ſelf-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or regiſtred in the large Catalogues of their ſins; and even thoſe who are convinced that Believing on Chriſt is a Duty neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96243:108"/>do neglect all diligent endeavours to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. Either becauſe they account, that it is a motion of the heart which may be eaſily performed at any time without any labour or diligent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; or on the contrary, becauſe they account it as difficult as all the works of the Law, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible for them to perform by their moſt diligent endeavours, except the Spirit of God work it in them by its mighty power. And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is in vain for them to work, until they feel this working of the Spirit in their Hearts: Or becauſe they account it a Duty ſo peculiar to the Elect, that it would be preſumption for them to endeavour the performance of it, until they know themſelves to be elected to Eternal Life through Chriſt. I ſhall urge you to a diligent performance of this Duty, notwithſtanding all theſe Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the following conſideration: It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our beſt endeavours, as appeareth by the preciouſneſs, excellency, and neceſſity of it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcovered.</p>
               <p>If the Light of Nature were not darkned in the matters of Salvation, then it would ſhew us, that we cannot of our ſelves find out the way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and would condemn thoſe that deſpiſe that Revelation of the way of Salvation that God hath given us in the Goſpel, declared in all the holy Scriptures. The great end of Preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is for the Obedience of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5. that ſo we may be brought to Chriſt, and all other Obedience; yea, the great end of all revealed Doctrines in the whole Scriptures, is to make us wiſe to Salvation by Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. The end of the Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> was for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96243:109"/>
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. and Chriſt was that end for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. The moral Law it ſelf was revealed in order to our Salvation, by believing on Chriſt, or elſe the knowledge of it had nothing availed fallen Man, that was unable to perform it. Therefore they that ſlight the Duty of Believing, and count it fooliſhneſs, do thereby ſlight, deſpiſe, and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſie the whole Counſel of God revealed in the Scripture: The Law and the Goſpel, and Chriſt himſelf, are become of none effect to the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch; the only fruit that ſuch an one can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to, of all the ſaving Doctrines of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is only ſome hypocritical moral Duties and ſlaviſh performances, which will be as filthy rags in the ſight of God in the great day. However, many mind not the ſin of unbelief in their ſelf-examinations, and write it not in their Scrouls, yet let them know, that this is the moſt pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſin of all: All the ſins in their Scrouls would not prevail to their Condemnation, yea, they would not prevail in their Converſation, were it not for their unbelief. This one ſin prevailing, maketh it impoſſible for them to pleaſe God in any. Duty whatſoever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. If you will not mind this one main ſin now, God will at laſt mind you of it with a Vengeance: For, <hi>He that believeth not on the Son ſhall not ſee Life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> Joh. 3.36. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, taking Vengeance on thoſe that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Believing on Chriſt, is a work that will require diligent endeavour and labour for the performance of it; we muſt labour to enter into that reſt, <hi>leſt any man fall by unbelief,</hi> Heb. 4.11. we muſt ſhew diligence
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96243:109"/>to the full aſſurance of hope to the end, that we may be followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherited the promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.11, 12. It is a work that requireth the exerciſe of Might and Power, and therefore we have need to be ſtrengthned with might by the Spirit in the inward Man, that Chriſt may dwell in our hearts by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, 17. I confeſs it is eaſie, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delicious in its own nature, becauſe it is a motion of the heart without any cumberſome bodily Labour; and it is a taking Chriſt and his Salvation as our own, which is very comfortable and delightful; and the Soul is carried forth in this by Love to Chriſt and his happineſs, which is an Affection which maketh even hard works eaſie and pleaſant; yet it is made difficult to us, by reaſon of the oppoſition that it meeteth withall from our own inward Corruptions, and from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations. It is no eaſie matter to receive Chriſt as our happineſs and true Salvation, with true confidence and lively affection, when the guilt of ſin lyeth heavily upon the Conſcience, and the wrath of God manifeſted by the Word, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Judgments, eſpecially when we have been long accuſtomed to ſeek Salvation by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our own works; and to account the way of Salvation by Free Grace, fooliſh and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when our Luſts encline us ſtrongly to the things of the fleſh and the World, when Satan doth his utmoſt by his own ſuggeſtions, and by falſe Teachers, and by worldly Allurements and Terrors to hinder the ſincere performance of this Duty. Many works that are eaſie in their own nature, prove difficult for us to perform in our Circumſtances: To forgive our enemies, and to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96243:110"/>love them as our ſelves, is but a motion of the mind, eaſie to be performed in its own nature; and yet many that are convinced of their Duty, find it a hard matter to bring their hearts to the performance of it. It is but a motion of the mind to caſt our Care upon God for worldly things, and rich Men may think that they can do it eaſily; but poor Men that have great Families, find it a hard matter. That eaſie comfortable Duty which <hi>Moſes</hi> exhorted the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to, when <hi>Pharoah</hi> with his Chariot and Horſe-men overtook them at the Red Sea, <hi>Be ye not afraid, ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew you this day,</hi> Exod. 14.13. was not eaſily performed. The very eaſineſs of ſome Duties makes their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance difficult, as <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> was hardly brought, <hi>to waſh and be clean,</hi> becauſe he thought it to be too ſlight and eaſie a Remedy for the Cure of his Leproſie, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.12, 13. even in this very caſe, people are offended at the Duty of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Chriſt, as too ſlight and eaſie a remedy to Cure the Leproſie of the Soul, they would have ſome harder thing enjoyned them to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of ſo great an end as this everlaſting Salvation. The performance of all the moral Law, is not accounted work enough for this end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.17, 20. However eaſie the work of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſeemeth to many, yet common Experience hath ſhewed, that Men are more eaſily brought to the moſt burdenſome, unreaſonable, and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Obſervations, as the Jows and Chriſtian <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians</hi> were more eaſily brought to take upon their Necks the Yoke of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s La w, which none were able to bear, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. The Heathens were more eaſily brought to burn their Sons and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96243:110"/>their Daughters in the Fire to their Gods, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.31. The Papiſts are brought more eaſily to the Vows of Chaſtity and Poverty, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the moſt rigorous rules of Monaſtick Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, to macerate and torture their Bodies with Faſtings, Scourgings, and Pilgrimages, and to bear all the exceſſive Tyranny of the Papal Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy, in a multitude of burdenſome ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ridiculous Devotions. They that ſlight the work of Faith for its eaſineſs, ſhew that they were never yet made ſenſible of innumerable ſins, and terrible Curſe of the Law, and Wrath of God that they lye under; and of the darkneſs and vanity of their Minds, the corruption and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts, and their bondage under the power of Sin and Satan, and have not bin truly humbled, without which they can't Believe in a right manner. Many ſound Believers have found by experience, that it hath bin a very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bring their Hearts to the Duty of Believing; it hath coſt them vigorous ſtruggles, and ſharp conflicts with their own Corruptions, and Satans Temptations. It is ſo difficult a work, that we can't perform it without the mighty working of the Spirit of God in our Hearts, who only can make it to be abſolutely eaſie to us, and doth make it eaſie, or ſuffer it to be difficult, according as he is pleaſed to communicate his Grace in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous degrees unto our Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tho we cannot poſſibly perform this great work in a right manner, until the Spirit of God work Faith in our Hearts by his mighty Power, yet it is neceſſary that we ſhould endeavour. And that before we can find the Spirit of God work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith effectually in us, or giving ſtrength to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96243:111"/>Believe. We can perform no holy Duty accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, except the Spirit of God work it in us; and yet we are not hereby excuſed from working our ſelves, but we are the rather ſtirred up to the greater diligence; <hi>Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2.12, 13. The way whereby the Spirit works Faith in the Elect, is by ſtirring them up to endeavour to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and this is a way ſuitable to the means that the Spirit uſeth, <hi>i. e.</hi> The Exhortations, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Invitations of the Goſpel, which would be of no force, if we were not to obey them, until we find Faith already wrought in us. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we poſſibly find, that the Spirit of God doth effectually work Faith, or give ſtrength to Believe, until we Act it; for all inward Graces, as well as all other inward Habits, are diſcerned by their Acts, as Seed in the Ground by its Springing. We cannot ſee any ſuch thing as Love to God or Man in our Hearts before we Act it: Children know not their Ability to ſtand upon their Feet, until they have made trial, by endeavouring ſo to do; ſo we know not our ſpiritual Strength, until we have learned by Experience from the uſe and exerciſe of it; neither can we know, or aſſure our ſeives abſolutely, that the Spirit of God will give us Strength to Believe before we Act Faith; for ſuch a Knowledge and Aſſurance if it be right, is ſaving Faith it ſelf in part; and whoſoever truſteth on Chriſt aſſuredly for ſtrength to believe by his Spirit, doth in effect truſt on Chriſt for his own Salvation, which is inſeparably joyned with the Grace of ſaving Faith. Tho the Spirit worketh other Duties in us by Faith, yet he
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96243:111"/>worketh Faith in us immediately by hearing, knowing and underſtanding the Word; <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.13. And in the Word he makes no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Promiſe or Declaration, that he will work Faith in this or that unbelieving Heart, or that he will give ſtrength to Believe to any one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or begin the work of Believing in Chriſt. for Faith it ſelf is the firſt Grace whereby we have a particular Intereſt in any ſaving Promiſe. It is a thing hidden in the ſecret Counſel and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God concerning us, whether he will give us his Spirit and ſaving Faith, until our Election be diſcovered by our Believing actually. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as ſoon as we know the Duty of Believing, we are to apply our ſelves immediately to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous performance of the Duty, and in ſo doing, we ſhall find that the Spirit of Chriſt hath ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us to Believe, tho we knew not certainly that it would do it before-hand. The Spirit cometh undiſcernably upon the Elect, to work Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, like the Wind that bloweth where it liſts, and none knoweth whence it cometh, and whither it goeth, but only we hear the ſound of it, and thereby know it when it is paſt and gone, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. we muſt therefore begin the work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we know that the Spirit doth or will work in us ſavingly: And we ſhall be willing to ſet upon the work if we Believe; <hi>for thy People ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. It is enough that God diſcovereth to us before-hand in the Goſpel, what Faith is, and the ground we have to Believe on Chriſt for our own Salvation; and that God requireth this Duty of us, and will help us in the performance of it, if we apply
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:96243:112"/>our ſelves heartily thereunto: <hi>Fear not, I command thee to be ſtrong, and of good courage,</hi> Joſh. 1. <hi>Ariſe and be doing, and the Lord will be with thee,</hi> 1 Chron. 22.16. Therefore whoſo receiveth this Goſpel-diſcovery as the Word of God in hearty Love, is taught by the Spirit, and will certainly come to Chriſt by Believing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. Every one that receiveth it not deſpiſeth God, maketh him a lyar, and deſerveth juſtly to periſh for his Unbelief.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Tho the Spirit worketh ſaving Faith only in the Elect, and others believe not, becauſe they are not of Chriſt's Sheep, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.26. and on that account its called the <hi>Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> Tit. 1.1. yet all that hear the Goſpel are obliged to the Duty of Believing, as well as to all the Duties of the moral Law, and that before they know their own particular Election; and they are lyable to Condemnation for Unbelief, as well as for any other ſin: <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed on the Navie of the only begotten Son of God,</hi> Joh. 3.18. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth, That the Elect <hi>Iſraelites</hi> obtained Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the reſt that were not Elected were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet even theſe were broken off from the good Olive-tree becauſe of their Unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7, 20. We cannot have a certain knowledge of our Election to Eternal Life before we do Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; it is a thing hidden in the unſearchable Counſel of God, until it be manifeſt by our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Calling and Believing on Chriſt. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle knew the Election of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> by ſind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evidence of their Faith, that the Goſpel came to them, not in <hi>Word only, but alſo in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much Aſſurance;</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:96243:112"/>that they had <hi>received the Word in much affliction, with joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.4, 5, 6. We are to ſee our Calling, if we would find out that God hath choſen us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.26, 27. therefore we muſt Believe on Chriſt before we know our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or elſe we ſhall never know it, and ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Believe; and it is no preſumption for us to truſt confidently on Chriſt for Everlaſting Life, before we have any good evidence of our Election, becauſe God that cannot Lye, hath made a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral promiſe, <hi>That whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed,</hi> without making the leaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among them that perform this Duty, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11, 12. The Promiſe is as firm and ſure to be fulfilled, as any of Gods Decrees and Purpoſes; and therefore it is a good and ſufficient ground for our Confidence. It is certain, that all that the Father hath given to Chriſt by the Decrees of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Election, ſhall come to Chriſt. And it is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally certain, that Chriſt will in no wiſe caſt out any that cometh to him, whoſoever he be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. And we need not fear that we ſhall infringe God's Decree of Election, by Believing on Chriſt confidently for our Salvation, before we know what God hath decreed concerning us. For if we Believe, we ſhall at laſt be found among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elect. And if we refuſe to Believe, we ſhall thereby wilfully ſort our ſelves among the Reprobates, that ſtumble at the Word, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, whereunto alſo they are appointed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. I ſhall add further, that tho we have no Evidence of our particular Election, before we Believe, yet we are to truſt on Chriſt aſſuredly, to make it evident to us, by giving us that Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which is the peculiar Portion of the Elect
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:96243:113"/>only: All ſpiritual ſaving Bleſſings wherewith God bleſſeth his People in Chriſt, are the peculiar Portion of them whom God hath choſen in Chriſt <hi>before the foundation of the World,</hi> Eph. 1.3, 4. yet we muſt neceſſarily truſt on Chriſt for thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Bleſſings, or have none at all: We are to pray in Faith nothing doubting, that God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member us with the favour that he beareth to his People, that we may ſee the good of his Choſen, and glory with his Inheritance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.4, 5. therefore we are to truſt aſſuredly on God, that he will deal with us as his Choſen People. Thus it appeareth, that it is not preſumption, but your bounden Duty, to apply your ſelves to the great work of Believing on Chriſt for Salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtioning at all before-hand, whether you are Elected or no: Secret things belong to God, but thoſe things that are revealed belong unto us, that we may do them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing directed to, is, that you ſhould endeavour for a right manner of performing this Duty. This is a point of great concernment, becauſe the want of it will render your Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual to Sanctification and Salvation. The great Duty of Love, which is the end of the Law, and the principal fruit of Sanctification muſt flow from Faith unfeigned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. There is a feigned Faith, that doth not really receive Chriſt into the Heart, and will not produce Love, or any true Obedience; ſuch as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13.23. for notwithſtanding his Faith, he was in the <hi>gall of bitterneſs, and in the bond of iniquity.</hi> And ſuch as thoſe Jews had, to whom Chriſt would not commit himſelf, who did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.23.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:96243:113"/>and 12.42. and ſuch as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeak of, <hi>What doth it profit you, my Brethren, if a man ſay he have Faith, and have not Works?</hi> Can that Faith ſave him? <hi>The Devils alſo believe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Jam.</hi> 2.14, 19. Take heed therefore leſt you deceive your Souls with a counterfeit Faith, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the precious Faith of God's Elect. The way to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, is by conſidering well what is the right manner of that Believing which is effectaal to Salvation: Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may perform the ſame Works for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with true Saints; but they are defective in the manner of performance, wherein the excellency of the Work doth chiefly conſiſt. One great reaſon why many ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, and are not able, is becauſe they are ignorant and defective in the right manner of Acting this Faith whereby they are to enter. Now I confeſs, that God only is able to guide us effectually in the right way of Believing; and we have this great Conſolation, when we ſee our own folly and proneneſs to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake our way, that if we heartily deſire and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Believe on Chriſt aright, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidently truſt on Chriſt to guide us. God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that the wayfaring Men, tho Fools, ſhall not err in the way of Holineſs; and that he will teach ſinners in the way; the Meek will he guide in Judgment, and the Meek will he teach his way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.8, 9. and he commandeth them that lack Wiſdom, to ask it of <hi>God in Faith, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting, Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6. But however, we are to know, that God guideth us only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of his Word; and we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to learn the right way of Believing out of the Word, or elſe we are not able ſo much as to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:96243:114"/>truſt rightly on God for guidance and direction in this great Work. To help you herein, I have given you before in this Treatiſe, a Deſcription of ſaving Faith; and have ſhewed that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth two Acts in it; the one is Believing the Truth of the Goſpel; the other is Believing on Chriſt as revealed, and freely promiſed to us in the Goſpel for all his Salvation. Now your great endeavour muſt be, to perform both theſe Acts in a right manner, as I ſhall ſhew concerning each of them in particular.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, you are highly concerned to endeavour for a right belief of the Truth of the Goſpel of Chriſt, that ſo you may be well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, diſpoſed and encouraged to Believe on Chriſt as revealed and promiſed in the Goſpel; hereby you are to remove all diſcomfortable thoughts and objections of Satan and your own Conſcience, and to overcome all corrupt Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that hinder a chearful embracing of Chriſt and his Salvation. It is found by experience, that when any fail in the ſecond Act of Faith, the reaſon of the failing is commonly ſome defect in this firſt Act. There is ſome falſe imagination or other in them, contrary to the belief of the Truth of the Goſpel; which is a ſtrong hold of Sin and Satan, that muſt be pulled down before they can receive Chriſt into their Hearts by Believing on him. If they knew the Name of Chriſt as he is diſcovered in the Goſpel, and judged aright of the Truth and Excellency of it, they would not fail to put their Truſt in him. And we are in great danger of entertaining ſuch falſe Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to account many Truths of the Goſpel ſtrange Paradoxes, yea fooliſh and pernicious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:96243:114"/>of our Ignorance, Self-conceitedneſs, guilty Conſciences, corrupt Affections, and manifold Errors wherewith our Judgments are prepoſſeſſed in matters of Salvation; and becauſe Satan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to beguil us, as he did <hi>Eve,</hi> through his ſubtilty to corrupt our minds from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel that is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. I ſhall therefore give you ſome particular Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are of greateſt moment to prevent ſuch defects as we are moſt lyable to in the firſt Act of our Faith.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt Believe with a full perſwaſion, that you are a Child of Wrath by Nature, as well as others, fallen from God by the ſin of the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, ſubject to the Curſe of the Law of God, and to the power of Satan, and to inſupportable miſery to all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And that you cannot poſſibly procure your reconciliation with God, or any ſpiritual Life and Strength to do any good work, by any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to get Salvation according to the terms of the Legal Covenant, and that you cannot find any way to eſcape out of this ſinful and miſerable Condition by your own Reaſon and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without ſupernatural Revelation, nor be freed from it, except by that infinite power that raiſeth the Dead. We muſt not be afraid as ſome are, to know our own vileneſs and ſinfulneſs, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we be willing to think our ſelves better than we are, but muſt be heartily deſirous and glad to know the worſt of our own Condition; yea, when we have found out the worſt that we can of our ſelves. Yea, we muſt be willing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our Hearts are deceitful, and deſperately wicked, beyond all that we can know and find
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:96243:115"/>out, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. This is all neceſſary to work in us true Humiliation, Self-deſpair, and Self-loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we may highly eſteem, and earneſtly ſeek the Salvation of Chriſt, as the one thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. It maketh us ſick of ſin, and ſenſible of our need of the great Phyſician, and willing to be ordered according to any of his preſcriptions, whatſoever we ſuffer, rather than to follow our own Wiſdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. It was for want of this Humiliation that the Scribes and Phariſees were not ſo forward to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, as the Publicans and Harlots, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are to believe aſſuredly, That there is no way to be ſaved without receiving all the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beneſits of Chriſt, his Spirit as well as his Merits, Sanctification as well as remiſſion of ſins by Faith. It is the ruin of many Souls, that they truſt on Chriſt for remiſſion of ſins without any regard to Holineſs, whenas theſe two Benefits are inſeparably joyned in Chriſt. So that none are freed from Condemnation by Chriſt, but thoſe that are enabled to walk holily, <hi>i. e.</hi> not after <hi>the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1. It is alſo the ruin of Souls to ſeek only remiſſion of ſins by Faith in Chriſt, and Holineſs by our endeavours, according to the terms of the Law, whereas we can never live to God in Holineſs, except we be dead to the Law, and live only by Chriſt living in us by Faith: That Faith that receiveth not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs as well as remiſſion of ſins from Chriſt, will never ſanctifie us, and therefore it will never bring us to heavenly Glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You are to be fully perſuaded of the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of Chriſt for the Salvation of your ſelf,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:96243:115"/>and of all that believe on him, that <hi>his blood cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. tho our ſins be never ſo great and horrible, and continued in never ſo long, yet he is able to deliver us from the body of Death, and mortifie our Corruptions be they never ſo ſtrong: We find in Scripture, that abominable wicked perſons have bin ſaved by him, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effeminate, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, Drunkards, Extortioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. Such as have ſinned againſt the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Heathen, and the Light of Scripture, as the Jews; ſuch as have denied Chriſt, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and perſecuted and blaſphamed him, as <hi>Paul;</hi> many that have fallen into great ſins are ruined for ever, becauſe they do not account the Grace of Chriſt ſufficient for their Pardon and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; when they think they are gone and paſt all hope of recovery, that their ſins are upon them, and they pine away in them, and how ſhall they live, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10. This deſpair works ſecretly in many Souls, without much trouble and horror, and maketh them careleſs of their Souls, and true Religion. The Devil ſills ſome with horrid, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, blaſphemous thoughts, on purpoſe that they may think their ſins too great to be forgiven, tho commonly ſuch thoughts are the leaſt of the ſins of thoſe that are peſtered with them, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devils ſin than theirs, becauſe they are hurried into them ſore againſt their wills; but if their Hearts be ſomewhat polluted with them, Chriſt teſtifieth, that <hi>all manner of ſin and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall be forgiven,</hi> beſides <hi>blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 10.31. And as for thoſe that are guilty of Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, the reaſon why they are never forgiven, is not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:96243:116"/>becauſe of any want of ſufficiency in the Blood of Chriſt, or in the pardoning mercy of God, but becauſe they never repent of that ſin, and never ſeek to God for mercy through Chriſt, but continue obſtinate until Death; for the Scripture teſtifieth, that it is impoſſible to renew them again by Repentance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6. So that the Merits of Chriſt are ſufficient for all that ſeek to him for mercy by Believing: There are others that deſpair of ever getting any Victory over their Luſts, becauſe they have formerly made many Vows and Reſolutions, and have uſed many vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Endeavours againſt them in vain: ſuch are to perſuade themſelves, that the Grace of Chriſt is ſufficient for them, when all other means have failed; as the Woman that had the Iſſue of Blood, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worſe by any Remedies that Phyſicians could preſcribe; yet perſuadeth her ſelf, that if ſhe might but touch the Cloths of Chriſt, <hi>ſhe ſhould be whole,</hi> Mar. 5.25, 28. Thoſe that deſpair by reaſon of the greatneſs of their Guilt and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, do greatly diſhonour and undervalue the Grace of God, his infinite mercy, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merits of Chriſt's Blood, and power of his Spirit, and deſerve to periſh with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas:</hi> Abundance of People that give up themſelves to all Licentiouſneſs in this wicked Generation, lye under ſecret Deſpair, which maketh them ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in Swearing, Blaſpheming, Whoring, Drunkenneſs, and all manner of Wickedneſs. How horrid and hainous ſoever our ſins and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions have bin, we ſhould learn to account them a ſmall matter in compariſon to the Grace of Chriſt, who is God as well as Man, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p n="4">4. You are to be fully perſwaded of the Truth of the General Free Promiſe in your own particular caſe, that if you believe on Chriſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, you ſhall have everlaſting Life, as well as any other in the World, without performing any condition of Works to procure an Intereſt in Chriſt: For the Promiſe is Univerſal, <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhanted,</hi> Rom. 9.32. without any Exception, and if God exclude you not, you muſt not exclude your ſelves, but rather conclude peremptorily, that how Vile, Wicked and Unworthy ſoever you be; yet if you come you ſhall be accepted as well as any other in the World; you are to believe the great Article of the Creed, the Remiſſion of Sins in your own caſe, when you are principally concerned, or elſe it will little profit you to believe it in the caſe of others. This is that which hinders many broken wounded Spirits from coming to the great Phyſician, when they are convinced of the abominable Filthineſs of their Hearts, that they are dead in Sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt ſpark of true Grace and Holineſs in them, they think that it is in vain for ſuch as they are, to truſt on Chriſt for Salvation, and that Chriſt will never ſave ſuch as they are; why ſo? They can be but loſt Creatures at worſt, and Chriſt came to ſeek and ſave thoſe that are loſt. If they that are Dead in Sin cannot be ſaved, then all muſt Deſpair and Periſh, for none have any Spiritual Life, until they receive it by Believing on Chriſt. Some think themſelves to be worſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96243:117"/>than any others, and that none have ſuch wicked Hearts as they; and tho others be accepted, yet they ſhall be rejected; but they ſhould know that Chriſt came to ſave the Chiefeſt of Sinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and that the deſign of God is to ſhew the exceeding Riches of his Grace in our Salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7. which is moſt glorified by pardoning the greateſt Sinners, and it is but our ignorance to think our ſelves like no Body; for all others, as well as we, are naturally Dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, their Mind is Enmity to God, and is not ſubject to his Law, nor can be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.8. and every Imagination of the Thoughts of their Hearts are only evil and continually ſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. they have all the ſame corrupt Fountain of all Abominations in their Hearts, tho we may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded many others in ſeveral actual Sins. Others think that they have out-ſtaid their time, and therefore now they ſhould find no place for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, tho they ſhould ſeek it carefully with Tears, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. but <hi>Behold, now is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

If you come into Chriſt's Vinyard at the eleventh Hour of the day, you ſhall have your Penny as well as thoſe that come early in the Morning, becauſe the Reward is of Grace and not of Merit, <hi>Matt.</hi> 20.9, 10. and here you muſt be ſure to believe ſtedfaſtly, that Chriſt and all his Salvation is beſtowed as a Free Gift upon thoſe that do not work to procure any Right or
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:96243:117"/>Title to him, or meetneſs or worthineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, but only believe on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. if you put any condition of Works or good Qualifications betwixt your ſelves and Chriſt, it will be a Partition wall that you can never climb over.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You are to believe aſſuredly, that it is the Will of God that you ſhould Believe in Chriſt, and have Eternal Life by him as well as any other; and that your Believing is a Duty very acceptable to God, and that he will help you as well as any other in this work, becauſe he calleth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth you by the Goſpel to Believe in Chriſt. This maketh us to ſet carefully upon the work of Believing; as when Jeſus commanded the blind Man to be called, they ſaid unto him, <hi>Be of good comfort and riſe,</hi> he calleth thee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29. A Command of Chriſt made <hi>Peter</hi> to walk upon the Water, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.29. And here we are not to meddle with Gods ſecret of Predeſtination, or the purpoſe of his Will to give the Grace of Faith to ſome rather than others; but only with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will in his gracious Invitations and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, by which we are required to Believe on Chriſt. This Will of God is confirmed by his Oath, <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of a ſinner, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 33.11. Chriſt teſtifieth, that he would often have <hi>gathered the Children of Jeruſalem as a hen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and they would not,</hi> Mat. 23.37. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth, that God <hi>will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1.4. you are to reject and abandon all thoughts that are contrary to this
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96243:118"/>perſuaſion. What if few be ſaved? Thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not make the number too great; for few will follow thee in the Duty of Believing. What if the Wrath of God be revealed from Heaven againſt thee in many terrible Judgments, and the Word and thine own Conſcience condemn thee, and Chriſt ſeem to reckon thee no better than a Dog, as he did the Woman of <hi>Canaan, Mat.</hi> 15.26. Thou art to make a good inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of all theſe things, that the end of them is, to drive thee to Chriſt, as this was the End of the Curſes of the Law, and all the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſpenſations of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. If a Prophet, or Angel from Heaven ſent of God on purpoſe to declare, that the Sentence of Everlaſting Damnation is declared againſt thee, it would be thy Duty to believe, that God ſent him to give thee timely warning, for this very end, that thou mighteſt Believe, and turn to God by Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſied againſt the Jews, that God would <hi>pluck them up, pull them down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them for their ſins;</hi> yet he himſelf taught them, <hi>If they turned from their evil ways, God would repent of the evil,</hi> Jer. 18.7, 8, 11. <hi>Jonah</hi> preached nothing but certain Deſtruction of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi> to be executed upon them within 40 days, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.4. yet the intent of that terrible meſſage was, that thoſe Heatheniſh People might eſcape Deſtruction by Repentance. The moſt abſolute and peremptory denunciations of Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt us while we are in this World, muſt be always underſtood with a ſecret reſerve of Salvation for us, upon our Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And we are to account, that the reaſon why God doth ſo terribly denounce his Judgments
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96243:118"/>againſt us by his Word is, that we may eſcape them, by flying for Refuge to his free Mercy in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Take heed of foſtering any thoughts, that God hath abſolutely decreed to ſhew no ſaving Mercy to you, or that you have already committed the unpardonable ſin; or that it is in vain for you to attempt the work of Believing, becauſe God will not help you in it. If ſuch thoughts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in your hearts, they will do you more hurt than the worſt blaſphemous thoughts that terrifie you, or any of the groſſeſt Abominations that ever you were guilty of; becauſe they obſtruct your Believing on Chriſt for Salvation. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Bride ſay, <hi>Come;</hi> Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will, let him take of the water of Life freely,</hi> Rev. 22.17. Therefore we are to abandon all thoughts that hinder our coming to Chriſt, as very ſinful and pernicious, ariſing in us from our own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and Satan's Deluſions, and utterly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the mind of Chriſt, and teachings of the Spirit; and what ground can we have to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch unbelieving thoughts? Hath God made us of his Privy-Council, that we ſhould be able to know that God hath decreed us to Damnation, before it be manifeſt by our final unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence? As for the unpardonable ſin, it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in renouncing the way of Salvation by Chriſt with the whole heart, after we have attained to the knowledge of it, and are convinced of the Truth of it by the Goſpel. Its the ſin that the Chriſtian <hi>Hebrews</hi> would have bin guilty of, if they had revolted from Chriſtianity to the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the unbelieving Jews, that accounted Chriſt to be an Impoſtor, and were moſt ranco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous perſecutors of him and his ways, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96243:119"/>5. They that have committed that ſin continue implacable, malicious Enemies to Chriſt and his ways to the end, without any repentance: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you can but find, that you deſire ſeriouſly to get an intereſt in Chriſt, and to be better Chriſtians than you are; if you be troubled and grieved that your Hearts and Lives are ſo wicked, and that you want Faith, Love, and true Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; yea, if your Hearts be not maliciouſly bent to perſecute the Goſpel, and prefer Atheiſm, Licentiouſneſs, or any falſe Religion before it, you have no cauſe to ſuſpect your ſelves to be guilty of this unpardonable ſin.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Add to all theſe, a full perſuaſion of the incomparable glorious Excellency of Chriſt, and of the way of Salvation by him. You are to eſteem the enjoyment of Chriſt as the only Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and true happineſs, and ſuch an happineſs as hath in it unſearchable Riches of Glory, and will make our Cup to run over with exceeding abundance of Peace and Joy, and full of Glory to all Eternity. We muſt <hi>account all things but loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Phil. 3.8. Incline your Wills and Affections to chooſe and embrace Chriſt as the Chief Good, and never to reſt ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Enjoyment of him; and to reject every thing that ſtands in Competition with him, or the Enjoyment of him. Chriſt is precious in the eſteem of all true Believers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. Their high eſteem of his incomparable preciouſneſs and excellency, induceth them to ſell all, that they may buy this <hi>Pearl of great price,</hi> Mat. 13.46. this maketh them to ſay, <hi>Lord evermore give us of this Bread, that cometh down from Heaven and giveth Life
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96243:119"/>to the World: Lord, to whom ſhall we go; thou hast the Words of Eternal Life,</hi> Joh. 6.32, 33, 68. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſavour of his good Ointments, <hi>his Name is as Ointment poured forth, therefore do the Virgins love him,</hi> Cant. 1.3. They are <hi>ſick of love to him, becauſe he is in their Eyes the chiefeſt of ten thouſand,</hi> Cant. 5.8, 10. As the Glory of God that appeared in the wonderful Beauty of the Temple, and in the Wiſdom and Glory of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> drew Worſhipers to God from the utmoſt parts of the Earth, ſo the unparallel'd excellency of Chriſt which was prefigured by the Glory of <hi>Solomon</hi> and the Temple, doth more powerfully draw Believers in theſe Goſpel-days. The Devil, who is the God of this World, knows how neceſſary it is for our Salvation, to diſcern all the Glory and Excellency of Chriſt; and therefore where the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is preached, he maketh it his great work, to Eclypſe the Glory of Chriſt in the Miniſtry, and to blind the minds of the People, leſt the Light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine into them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. One that is convinced of the truth of the Goſpel may be averſe to the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of it, until he ſee alſo the goodneſs of it, that <hi>Christ is altogether lovely and excellent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the ſecond principal Act of Faith, whereby Chriſt himſelf, and his Spirit, and all his ſaving Benefits are actually received into the Heart; which is, <hi>Believing on Christ as revealed, and freely promiſed to us in the Goſpel for all his Salvation.</hi> The Spirit of God doth habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſpoſe and encline our Hearts to a right performance of this act, by enabling us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the firſt Act according to the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, by believing aſſuredly thoſe great
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96243:120"/>things of the Goſpel, whereby we are delivered into <hi>a form of doctrine,</hi> Rom. 6.17. which we are to obey from our hearts, and to follow as our pattern in the manner of our Acting Faith in Chriſt for Salvation. Therefore I need only to exhort you briefly to Act your Faith in Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that form and pattern in which you have bin already ſo largely inſtructed. You are to believe in Chriſt as alone ſufficient, and all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for your Happineſs and Salvation; deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether of any attainment of Happineſs by your own Wiſdom, Strength, works of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or any fleſhly worldly Confidences what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: We muſt be as dead People to all other Confidences, and account them to be <hi>loſs for Chriſt,</hi> according to the example of the bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 7, 8. We muſt not be grieved that we have nothing to truſt upon beſides Chriſt, for our Salvation, but rather, we are to rejoyce that we need nothing elſe, and that we have a ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to rely upon, incomparably better than any other that can be imagined: And we muſt reſolve to caſt the burden of our Souls wholly on Chriſt, and to ſeek Salvation no other way, whatſoever becomes of us. If the Cripple lay not the whole weight of his Body upon a ſtrong Staff, but part of it on a rotten one, he is like to receive a fall. If the Swimmer will not commit his Body wholly to the Water to bear him up, but catch at Weeds, or ſtruggle to feel out Ground, he may ſink to the bottom. Chriſt will be all our Salvation, or nothing; if we ſeek to be ſaved by any other ways, as the <hi>Galatians</hi> did by Circumciſion, <hi>Chriſt will profit us nothing,</hi> Gal. 5.2. You are alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt meerly as a free-gift, given to the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96243:120"/>Chief of ſinners, reſolving that you will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form any Conditions to procure your ſelves a right and title to him: But that you will come to him as a loſt ſinner, an ungodly Creature, truſting on him that <hi>Justifieth the ungodly;</hi> and that you will <hi>buy him without mony,</hi> and <hi>without any price</hi> whatſoever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. Look not on your own Faith or Love, or any good Qualifications in your ſelves, as the ground of your truſting in Chriſt, but only to the free Grace and loving-kindneſs of God in Chriſt. <hi>How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is thy loving-kindneſs O God! therefore the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men put their truſt under the ſhadow of thy Wings,</hi> Pſal. 30.7. For if you make your Faith, Love, or good Qualifications to be your firſt and principal Foundation, and you build Chriſt upon them, inſtead of building all upon Chriſt, you invert the order of the Goſpel, and Chriſt will profit you nothing.</p>
               <p>Another thing to be obſerved diligently is, that you muſt come to Chriſt for a new holy Heart and Life, and all things neceſſary thereunto, as well as for deliverance from the wrath of God, and the torments of Hell. You muſt alſo come to him with an ardent Love and Affection to him, and eſteem him better than a thouſand Worlds, and the only excellent Portion, loathing and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring your ſelf as a vile, ſinful, and miſerable Creature, and accounting all things Dung in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of his Excellency, that you may be able to ſay from the bottom of your Heart, <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee?</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 73.23.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, You muſt endeavour to draw near with <hi>full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. truſting on Chriſt confidently for your own particular Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96243:121"/>upon the account of that general promiſe, <hi>That whoſoever believeth on Chriſt ſhall not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> Rom. 9.33. You muſt check your ſelves for all doubtings, fears, ſtaggerings concerning your own Salvation by Chriſt, ſaying with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11.</p>
               <p>The third thing contained in the direction is; The avoiding of all delay in the performance of this great work of <hi>Believing in Chriſt.</hi> Until we have performed it, we continue under the power of Sin and Satan, and under the wrath of God, and there is nothing betwixt Hell and us, beſides the Breath of our Noſtrils. Its dangerous for <hi>Lot</hi> to linger in <hi>Sodom,</hi> leſt Fire and Brimſtone come down from Heaven upon him. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer muſt flee with all haſte to the City of refuge, <hi>leſt the avenger of blood purſue him while his Heart is hot, and ſlay him,</hi> Deut. 19.5, 6. We ſhould make haſte, and not delay, <hi>to keep Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Pſal. 119.60. and <hi>flee for refuge to the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6.18. And God commandeth us to flee thus by Faith, without which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God in other Duties. The work is of ſuch a nature, that it may be performed as ſoon as you hear the Goſpel. As ſoon as they hear of me, they <hi>ſhall obey me,</hi> Pſal, 18.44. As ſoon as <hi>Zion travailed ſhe brought forth her Children,</hi> Iſa. 66.8. We have many examples of thoſe that received the Word by Faith at the firſt hearing of it. Three Thouſand were added to the Church on the very ſame day wherein <hi>Peter</hi> firſt publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Goſpel in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 2.41. ſo, many <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were converted at the firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 13.43.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96243:121"/>The Jaylor, with all his houſe believed, and were baptized the ſame Night wherein <hi>Paul</hi> firſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.33, 34. The Goſpel came at firſt to the <hi>Theſſalonians, not in Word only, but in Power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.5, 6. If God open the Hearts of his People to attend diligently, they may be inſtructed in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel by one brief Sermon, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to begin the practice of ſaving Faith; and when they know their Duty, God requireth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate performance, without allowing us the leaſt reſpit in the ſtate of Unbelief. When Satan cannot prevail with People, to reject wholly the Duty of Believing, his next attempt for the ruin of their Souls is, to prevail with them at leaſt, to delay and ſhift off the performance of it from time to time, by ſeveral falſe reaſonings and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he putteth into their minds; the moſt ignorant and ſenſual are eaſily prevailed with to defer this Duty, until they have taken their fill of the pleaſures, profits, and honours of this World; and are ſummoned to prepare for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, by Infirmities, Age, Sickneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hoping, that a large time of Repentance will be granted unto them before they dye. But ſuch delays ſhew, that they are really unwilling to Repent and Believe, until they are forced by neceſſity; and that they prefer the pleaſures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits and honours of the World, above God and Chriſt, and their own Souls. Thus they unfit themſelves more and more for this great Duty, by their cuſtomary walking in ſin, and by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending the precious time of their Health and Strength, which is moſt meet for the performance of this great Work. They highly provoke God
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96243:122"/>never to give them Time, or Grace to Repent hereafter. Others imagine, that after they have heard the Goſpel of Salvation by Chriſt, they may lawfully defer the Believing of it, until they have ſufficiently examined the Truth of ſome other different Doctrin, or until God be pleaſed to afford them ſome other means, to aſſure them fully of the Truth of the Goſpel. Thus they that are called Seekers, miſ-ſpend the day of Grace, ever learning, but never coming to the <hi>knowledg of the Truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.7. But the Truth of the Goſpel doth ſo clearly evidence its ſelf by its own Light, That if People do not wilfully ſhut their Eyes, or blind themſelves by their own Pride, and love of their Luſts, they would eaſily perceive that it is the Truth of God, becauſe the Image of his Grace, Mercy, Power, Juſtice and Holineſs, appears manifeſtly engraven upon it. It is a ſign People are Proud, when they conſent not to the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to the <hi>Doctrine which is according to Godlineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. If they were humble, and ſincerely inclined to do the Will of God, they would know whether the Doctrine be of God or no, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17. They would quickly be perſuaded of the Truth (by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles) ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to them in the Scripture; and if they will not hear them, neither will they <hi>not be perſuaded tho one roſe from the dead;</hi> or whatever other Miracle be wrought to confirm the Divine Authority of the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.31. Another ſort of People there are, that delay the great work of Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the ruin of their Souls, upon the outward means of Grace and Salvation, inſtead of any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to receive Chriſt by Faith, tho they be
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:96243:122"/>convinced of the Truth of the Goſpel: This they call waiting upon God at the doors of his Grace and Salvation, in the uſe of Means appointed by him, and ſitting under the droppings of the Sanctuary. But let them know, that this is not the right waiting on God required in Scripture; it is rather diſobedience to God, and to the Name of his appointment, which requires, that we ſhould be <hi>doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving our ſelves,</hi> Jam. 1.22. and that we ſhould come in to the <hi>ſpiritual Feaſt,</hi> Luke 14.23. and not only ſtand at the door, or ſit under the droppings of the Houſe of God, leſt Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute us no better than eve-droppers. That holy waiting on the Lord commended to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ever accompanied with Believing and Hoping in the Lord, and dependeth thereon. I had <hi>fainted, unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the Land of the Living,</hi> Pſal. 23.13, 14. <hi>It is good that a Man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord,</hi> Lam. 3.26. What is it that theſe deluded ones wait for, before they perform the Duty of Believing? Is it for more knowledge of the Goſpel? The way to encreaſe thy Knowledge as well as any other Talent, is to make uſe of what thou haſt received already; Believe heartily on Chriſt for all thy Salvation, according to that little knowledge of the Goſpel which thou haſt, and thou wilt have an intereſt in the promiſe of knowledge contained in the New Covenant, <hi>They ſhall all know me from the leaſt to the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31.34. Is it for the appointed time of thy Converſion that thou waiteſt? then thou waiteſt as thoſe impotent folk lay at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> waiting for the Seaſon when
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:96243:123"/>the Angel would come down and move the Water; know then that if thou enter into Chriſt now by Faith, thou ſhalt find in him Waters of Life, and the Spirit moving them for the Healing and Quickning of thy Soul. God hath appointed by his Word, that it ſhall be thy Duty to endeavour that the preſent time ſhould be the time of thy Converſion, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>To day if thou wilt hear his Voice, harden not thy Heart,</hi> Heb. 3.7, 8. and thou ſhalt never know at what time God hath purpoſed in his Secret Counſel to give Faith to thee, until thou doſt actually believe. Doſt thou wait for any Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations or Flowings in of Gods ſaving Love to thy Soul? Then the way to obtain it is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the God of Peace may ſill thee with all Joy and Peace in Believing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. Thou haſt ſufficient Manifeſtation of Gods Love to thy Soul, by the free Promiſes of Life and Salvation by Chriſt; do but truſt on the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon thy God, when thou walkeſt in Darkneſs and ſeeſt no Light of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Comforts any other way. Otherwiſe thou waiteſt for Comfort in vain, and this thou ſhalt have at the Lords hand, thou ſhalt <hi>lye down in Sorrow,</hi> Iſa. 50.10, 11. Doſt thou wait for any Qualifications to prepare thee for the work of Believing? If they be good and Holy Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, thou canſt not have them before Faith; but they are either included in the Nature of Faith, or they are Fruits of it, as hath been largely proved. If they be bad and Sinful, it's ſtrange that any ſhould wait for them, and yet no more ſtrange than true: Some fooliſhly wait to be terrified with the Senſe of Gods Wrath,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96243:123"/>and deſpairing Thoughts; and theſe they call the Pangs of the New Birth, tho in their own Nature they are rather the Pangs of the Spiritual Death, and bring forth Hatred to God rather than Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore we ſhould ſtrive to prevent them, by believing Gods Love in Chriſt, rather than to wait for them: It is true that God maketh theſe deſpairing Thoughts as well as other Sins, work for good to them that are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from them by Faith in Chriſt, they are moved thereby to hate Sin, and to prize Chriſt the more, and the Comforts of his Goſpel, and to loath and abhor themſelves, yet many are brought to Chriſt without them, by Gods giving them the knowledge of their own Sins, and of Chriſt's Salvation together; ſeveral Examples of theſe were above mentioned, who received the Word with Joy at the firſt hearing of it: And we muſt not deſire or wait for any evil of Sin, ſuch as theſe deſpairing thoughts are, that good may come of it: Neither ſhould we expect to be worſe before we be better, when we may and ought to be better preſently by believing on Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the direction it is, that we ſhould continue and increaſe in the moſt Holy Faith; and that we may, we muſt not think that when we have once attained to the Grace of ſaving Faith, and thereby are begotten anew in Chriſt, our Names are up in Heaven and perfect, we may lye in Bed till Noon; but as long as we continue in this Life, we muſt endeavour to continue in the Faith grounded and ſetled, not moved away from the hope of the Goſpel, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. and to hold the beginning of our Confidence, and the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96243:124"/>rejoycing of hope ſtedfaſt to the end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.14. and build up our ſelves in the moſt Holy Faith, <hi>Jude</hi> 20. abounding therein with Thankſgiving, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. Tho we receive Chriſt freely by Faith, yet we are but Babes in Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1. and we muſt not account, that we have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained or are made perfect, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.12, 13. but we muſt ſtrive to be more rooted and built up in him, until we come to the perfect Man, to the meaſure of the Stature of the fullneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.13. If the new Nature be really in us by Regeneration, it will have an Appetite to its own continuance and Increaſe, until it come to Perfection as the New Born Babe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. And we are not only to receive Chriſt and a new Holy Nature by Faith, but alſo to live and walk by it, and to reſiſt the Devil, and to quench all his fiery Darts by it, and alſo to grow in Grace and to perfect Holineſs in the fear of God, for we are kept by the mighty Power of God through Faith unto Salvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. as all our Chriſtian Warfare is the good Fight of Faith. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. All Spiritual Life and Holineſs continue, grow or decay in us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Faith continueth, groweth or decayeth in Vigour; but when this Faith beginneth to ſink by Fears and Doubtings, the Man himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to ſink together with it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 14.29, 31. Faith is like the Hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> while it is held up <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevails, when it is let down <hi>Amaleck</hi> prevails, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. this continuance and growth in Faith will require our Labour and Induſtry as well as the beginning, tho we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

The Church meeteth with great Difficulties in her marching through the Wilderneſs of this World to the Heavenly Canaan, as well as in her firſt Deliverance from Egyptian Bondage; yea, we often meet with greater Difficulties in going to Perfection, than we did in the beginning of the Good Work.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight manner as I have taught you, to begin this great Work of Believing in Chriſt, that your Faith may be of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Beginning to the End, though it increaſe in Degrees; for our Faith is imperfect and joyned with much Unbelief in this World, and we had need to pray ſtill, <hi>Lord I believe, help my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,</hi> Mar. 9.24. and therefore we have need to ſtrive for more Faith, that we may receive Chriſt in greater Perfection. If you find your Faith hath produced good Works, you ſhould thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe your Confidence in Chriſt for Salvation by his meer Grace: But take heed of changing the nature of your Faith, from truſting on the Grace and Merits of Chriſt, to truſting on your own Works, according to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrin, that our firſt Juſtification is by Grace and Faith only, but our ſecond Juſtification is alſo by Works. Beware alſo of truſting on Faith it ſelf as a work of Righteouſneſs, inſtead of truſting on Chriſt by Faith: If you do not find that your Believing in ſuch a right manner as I have deſcribed, doth
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:96243:125"/>produce ſuch Fruits of Holineſs as you deſire, you ought not to diminiſh, but rather to increaſe your Confidence in Chriſt, knowing that the weakneſs of your Faith hindereth its Fruitfulneſs; and the greater your Confidence is concerning the Love of God to you in Chriſt, the greater will be your Love to God and to his Service. If you fall into any groſs Sin after the work is begun in you, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did, think not that you muſt caſt away your Confidence and expect nothing but Wrath from God and Chriſt, and that you muſt refuſe to be comforted by the Grace of Chriſt, at leaſt for ſome time; for thus you would be the more weak and prone to fall into other Sins; but rather ſtrivo to believe more confidently that you <hi>have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous; and that he is the Propitiation for our Sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.1, 2. and let not the guilt of Sin ſtay at all upon your Conſcience, but waſh it away with all ſpeed, in the Fountain of Chriſts Blood which is opened for us, that it may be ready for our uſe on all ſuch incident Occaſions; that ſo you may be humbled for your Sins in a Goſpel way, and may hate your own Sinfulneſs, and be ſorry for it with Godly Sorrow out of Love to God. <hi>Peter</hi> might have been ruined for ever by denying of Chriſt, as <hi>Judas</hi> was by betraying him, if <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith had not been upheld by the Prayer of Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. If a Clould be caſt over all your inward Qualifications, ſo that you can ſee no Grace at all in your ſelves, yet ſtill truſt on him that juſtifyeth the Ungodly, and came to ſeek and to ſave them that are loſt. If God ſeem to deal with you as an Enemy, by bringing on you ſome horrible Affliction, as he did upon <hi>Job,</hi> beware of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96243:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>demning your Faith and its Fruits, as if they were not acceptable to God, but rather ſay with holy <hi>Job, Though he ſlay me, yet will I trust in him, but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</hi> Strive to keep and to increaſe Faith by Faith; i. e. by acting Faith frequently, by truſting on God to keep and increaſe it, being confident that he that hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the <hi>day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6.</p>

               </argument>
               <head>EXPLICATION.</head>
               <p>HEre I am guiding you to the manner of Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, wherein you are to make uſe of Faith
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96243:126"/>and of all other effectual means of Holyneſs before treated of, which Faith layeth hold on, for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Performance of the Law, which is the great end aimed at in this whole Treatiſe: And therefore this deſerveth to be diligently conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the principal Direction, to which all the foregoing and following, are ſubſervient. As for the meaning of it, I have already ſhewed that our old natural State, is that which we derive from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by natural Generation, and it is called in the Scripture the Old Man, and while we be in it, we are ſaid to be in the Fleſh; and our new State is that which we receive from the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, being new born in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Fellowſhip with him through Faith: And it is called in Scripture, the New Man, and when we are in it, we are ſaid to be in the Spirit. The Principles and Means of Practice belonging to a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural State, are ſuch as Perſons do or may attain to and make uſe of, before they are in Chriſt by Faith. Such as belong properly to the New-State, are the manifold holy Endowments, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Enjoyments which we partake of in Chriſt by Faith, ſuch as have already appeared to be the only effectual means of a Holy Life. We are ſaid to walk according to either of theſe States, or to the Principles or Means that belong to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, when we are moved and guided by Vertue of them, to ſuch actings as are agreeable to them. Thus Kings act according to their State, in commanding Authoritatively, and in magnifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Bounty; poor Men in the way of Service and Obedience; and Children indiſcreetly, <hi>Heſter</hi> 1.7. <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.23. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. So the Manner of Practice here directed to, conſiſts in moving and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96243:126"/>guiding our ſelves in the Performance of the Works of the Law by Goſpel Principles and Means: This is the rare and excellent Art of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, in which, every Chriſtian ſhould ſtrive to be skilful and expert. The reaſon why many come off with ſhame and Confuſion, after they have a long time laboured with much Zeal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry for the Attainment of true Godlineſs, is becauſe they were never acquainted with this holy Art, and never endeavoured to practiſe in a right Goſpel way. Some worldly Arts are called My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, but above all, this Spiritual Art of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is without Controverſie <hi>a great Myſtery,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. becauſe the Means that are to be made uſe of in it, are deeply Myſterious, as hath been ſhewed, and you are not a skilful Artiſt till you know them, and can reduce them to Practice. It is a manner of Practice far above the Sphere of Natural Ability, ſuch as would never have entred into the Hearts of the Wiſeſt in the World, if it had not been Revealed to us in the Scriptures; and when it is there moſt plainly Revealed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth a dark Riddle to thoſe that are not inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inlightned and Taught by the Holy Spirit: Such, as many Godly Perſons guided by the Spirit and do in ſome meaſure walk in, yet do but obſcure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcern, that they can hardly perceive their own Knowledge of it, and can hardly give any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to others of the way wherein they walk. As the Diſciples that walked in Chriſt the way to the Father, and yet perceived not that Knowledge in themſelves, <hi>Lord we know not whether thou goeſt, and how can we know the way?</hi> Joh. 14.5. This is the reaſon why many poor Believers are ſo weak in Chriſt, and attain to ſo ſmall a Degree of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:96243:127"/>and Righteouſneſs. Therefore that you may the better be acquainted with a Myſtery of ſo high Concernment, I ſhall ſhew in the firſt place, that the Holy Scriptures do direct you to this manner of Practice, as only effectual for the Performance of Holy Duties; and then I ſhall lay before you ſome neceſſary Inſtructions, that you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how to walk aright in it, and continue and go forward therein, till you be made perfect in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, the Holy Scriptures are very large and clear, in directing us to this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Practice, and to Continuance and Growth therein. And here it is uſeful for us to obſerve the great Variety of peculiar Words and Phraiſes, whereby the Holy Ghoſt teacheth this Myſtery, which many that frequently read the Scriptures, yea that pretend to be Preachers of the Goſpel, do little underſtand or regard, ſhewing thereby that the things of the Spirit of God are Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them, and that they are not yet acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the form of ſound Words, and are ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the very Language of the Goſpel which they profeſs and pretend to preach. I ſhall therefore preſent to your View ſeveral of thoſe particular Words and Phraſes whereby this myſterious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Practice is expreſs'd in the Holy Scriptures, and commended to you as the only way for the ſure Attainment of all Holineſs in Heart and Life. I ſhall rank ſuch of them together as agree in Senſe, that the Multitude of them may not breed Confuſion in your Thoughts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is the manner of Practice in Scripture, which is expreſſed by <hi>living by Faith</hi> Hab. 2.4. Gal. 2.20. Heb. 10.38. <hi>Walking by Faith.</hi> 2 Cor.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96243:127"/>5.7. <hi>Faith working by Love.</hi> Gal. 5.6. <hi>Overcoming the World by Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. <hi>Quenching all the fiery Darts of the Wicked, by the Shield of Faith,</hi> Eph. 6.19, 20. Some make no more of <hi>living and walking by Faith,</hi> than meerly a ſtirring up, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging our ſelves to our Duty by ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as we believe. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> might account that they <hi>believed by Faith,</hi> becauſe they profeſſed and aſſented unto the Doctrin of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and were moved thereby to a Zeal of God, though they ſought <hi>righteouſneſs not by Faith,</hi> but as it were, <hi>by the Works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.32. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> might think he <hi>lived by Faith</hi> while he was a zealous <hi>Phariſee,</hi> but afterwards he knew, that the <hi>life of Faith</hi> conſiſted in <hi>dying to the Law and living to God;</hi> and that not himſelf, but <hi>Chriſh, lived in him,</hi> Gal. 2.19. as it is one and the ſame thing to be <hi>juſtifyed by Faith, and Chriſt believed on,</hi> Rom. 5.1. ſo to <hi>live, walk and work by Faith,</hi> is all one with <hi>living, walking, working</hi> by means of Chriſt and his ſaving Endowments which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and make uſe of by Faith, to guide and move our ſelves to the Practice of Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame thing is commended to us by the Terms of <hi>walking, rooted and built up in Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2.6. <hi>living to God as not to live to our ſelves, but to have Chriſt living in us,</hi> Gal. 2.19, 20. <hi>Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.16. <hi>Putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that we may <hi>walk honeſtly as in the day,</hi> Rom. 13.13, 14. <hi>Being ſtrong in the Lord and the power of his might,</hi> Eph. 6.10.11. Doing all things <hi>in the name of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.17. <hi>walking up and down in the name of the Lord,</hi> Zech. 10.12. <hi>going in the ſtrength of the Lord, as to make mention of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, even of his only,</hi> Pſal. 71.16. Theſe
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96243:128"/>phraſes are frequent, and do ſufficiently explain one another; and do ſhew, that we are to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Holineſs, not only by vertue of Chriſts Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but alſo of his ſtrengthning Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments moving us and encouraging us thereunto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is alſo ſignified by the phraſes of being, <hi>ſtrong in the Grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.1. having your <hi>Converſation in the World not with fleſhly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. having, or <hi>holding fast Grace, that we may ſerve God acceptably, labouring abundantly in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> as that the whole work is not performed by us, but <hi>by the Grace of God that is with us,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. By Grace therefore, we may well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the priviledges of our new ſtate given to us in Chriſt, whereby we ought to be influenced and guided in the performance of holy Duties.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is alſo ſignified when we are to <hi>put off the old,</hi> and <hi>put on the new Man;</hi> yea, to continue in ſo doing, tho we have done it in a meaſure already, and that we avoid our former <hi>ſinful Converſation,</hi> Epheſ. 4.21, 22, 24. and to avoid ſin, becauſe we have <hi>put off the old,</hi> and <hi>put on the new Man,</hi> Col. 3.9, 10, 11. I have already ſhewed, that by this <hi>twofold man,</hi> is not meant merely <hi>ſin and holineſs:</hi> but by the former meant our natural Eſtate, with all its Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby we are furniſhed only to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of ſin; and by the later, or new Eſtate in Chriſt, that whereby we are furniſhed with all means neceſſary for the practice of Holineſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We are to underſtand the ſame thing, when we are taught, <hi>not to walk after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> that we may be <hi>free from the Law of ſin,</hi> and that the <hi>righteouſneſs of the Law may be fulfilled in us,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 2, 3. and through the Spirit to <hi>mortifie
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96243:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>the deeds of the body,</hi> and to be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> becauſe we live by the Spirit, and have <hi>cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. The Apoſtle doth ſhew by theſe expreſſions, not only that we are to <hi>practiſe holineſs,</hi> but alſo <hi>by what means we may do it effectually.</hi> By the Fleſh is meant, our old Nature derived from the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> And by the Spirit, is meant the Spirit of Chriſt, and that new Nature which we have by him dwelling in us. We are ſaid to walk after either of theſe Natures, when we make the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties or Qualifications of either of them to be the principles of our Practice. So when we are taught to ſerve in <hi>newneſs of the ſpirit,</hi> and not in the oldneſs of the Letter, that ſo we may bring forth <hi>fruits unto God:</hi> The meaning is, that we muſt endeavour to bring forth the <hi>fruits of holineſs,</hi> not by vertue of the Law, that killing Letter, to which the Fleſh is married, and by which the motions of ſin are in us; but by vertue of the Spirit, and his manifold Riches which we partake of in our new ſtate, by a <hi>myſtical marriage with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 7.4, 5, 6. and by vertue of ſuch Principles as belong to the New State, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Goſpel, whereby the <hi>holy ſpirit is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. This is the manner of walking which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> directeth us unto, when he teacheth us by his own Example, That the continual work of our lives ſhould be <hi>to know Christ, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his Sufferings, being made conformable to his Death, if by any means we may attain to the Reſurrection of the dead, and to encreaſe and preſs forward in this kind of knowledge,</hi> Phil. 3.10, 11, 12, 15. Certainly he meaneth ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96243:129"/>knowledge of Chriſt, and his Death and Reſurrection, as effectually makes us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable thereunto in dying to ſin, and living to God. And he would hereby guide us to make uſe of Chriſt and his Death and Reſurrection, by Faith, as the powerful means of all Holineſs in Heart and Life; and to encreaſe in this manner of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, until we attain unto <hi>perfection in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing propoſed, was, to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſome neceſſary Inſtructions, that your ſteps may be guided aright, to continue and go forward in this way of Holineſs, until you be made perfect in Chriſt. And ſeeing we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally prone to miſtake this way, and are utterly unable to find it out, or diſcern it by our own Reaſon and Underſtanding, we ſhould the more diligently attend to theſe Inſtructions taken out of the Holy Scriptures. And we ſhould <hi>pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,</hi> that God would give unto us the <hi>Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation,</hi> that we may <hi>diſcern the way of Holineſs thereby,</hi> and walk aright in it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that gracious promiſe, <hi>The wayfaring men, tho Fools, ſhall not err therein,</hi> Iſa. 35.8.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Obſerve and conſider diligently in our whole Converſation, That tho you are partakers of a new holy ſtate by Faith in Chriſt, yet our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate doth remain, in a meaſure, with all its corrupt Principles and Properties; as long as we live in this preſent World, our apprehenſion of Chriſt and his perfection in this Life is only by Faith, whereas by Senſe and Reaſon we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend much in our ſelves contrary to Chriſt; and this Faith is imperfect: So that true Believers have cauſe to pray to God to help their Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24. Therefore, tho we receive per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96243:129"/>Chriſt by Faith, yet the meaſure and degree of enjoying him is imperfect, and we hope ſtill, ſo long as we are in this World, to enjoy him in a higher degree of perfection than we have done; we are yet but <hi>weak in Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.4. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in compariſon to the <hi>perfection</hi> we expect in another World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10, 11. and we muſt grow ſtill, till we come to the <hi>perfect man,</hi> Eph. 4.13. and ſome are leſs Babes than others, and have received Chriſt in ſo ſmall a meaſure, that they may be accounted <hi>carnal rather than ſpiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.1. And becauſe all the Bleſſings and Perfections of our new ſtate, as Juſtification, the gift of the Spirit, and of the holy Nature, and the Adoption of Children, are ſeated and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in Chriſt, and joyned with him inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, we can receive them no further than we receive Chriſt himſelf by Faith, which we do in an imperfect meaſure and degree in this Life. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> propoſeth himſelf as a pattern for all thoſe that are <hi>perfect in the truth of Grace,</hi> to imitate. And yet he profeſſeth, That he was not yet made ſo perfect in the degree or meaſure of ſaving Endowments, but that he did ſtill <hi>preſs forward towards the mark of the prize of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> labouring ſtill to apprehend and win Chriſt more perfectly; and <hi>to be found in him, not having his own Righteouſneſs, but that which is of God by Faith;</hi> and to gain more experimental <hi>knowledge of Chriſt, and of the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his ſufferings,</hi> and the <hi>power of his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being made conformable thereunto,</hi> Phil 3.8, 10. Believers are Juſtified already, yet wait for the hope of Righteouſneſs by Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> for the <hi>full enjoyment of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 5.5.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96243:130"/>They have received but the <hi>firſt-fruits of the ſpirit,</hi> and muſt wait for a more full enjoyment of it. The Spirit witneſſeth now to them, that <hi>they are the Children of God;</hi> and yet they <hi>groan within themſelves, waiting for more full enjoyment of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Rom. 8.23. Now ſeeing the degree and meaſure of our Reception and Enjoyment of Chriſt, with all the Bleſſings of our new ſtate in him in this Life is imperfect, it followeth clearly, that our contrary natural ſtate with its Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remaineth ſtill in us in ſome degree, and is not perfectly aboliſhed; ſo that all Believers in this World, do in ſome degree partake of theſe two contrary ſtates. Believers have indeed put off <hi>the old man, and put on the new man, where Chriſt is all, and in all,</hi> Col. 3.10, 11. yet they are to put the old Man off, and the new Man on more and more, becauſe the old Man remaineth ſtill in a meaſure. They are ſaid to be, <hi>not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit;</hi> becauſe their being in the Spirit is their beſt and laſting ſtate, as denominations are uſually taken from the better part, but yet the Fleſh is in them, and they find work enough to mortify the deeds of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.13. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeveral things which are contrary to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are frequently attributed to Believers in the Scripture, with reſpect to theſe two contrary States, wherein one place ſeems to contradict an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and yet both are true in divers reſpects: Thus holy <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith truly of himſelf, <hi>I live, yet not I;</hi> Gal. 2.20. becauſe he did live to God by Chriſt living in him; and yet in another reſpect according to his natural State, he did not live to God. Again, he profeſſeth that he was carnal, ſold under Sin, and yet on the contrary, that he
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96243:130"/>allowed not Sin but hated it; he ſheweth how both theſe were true concerning himſelf: In di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe reſpects he ſaith, in me, that is, in my Fleſh dwelleth no good thing. And I delight to do the Will of God according to the Inner-Man: With my Mind I my ſelf ſerve the <hi>Law of God</hi> but with my Fleſh, the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7.14.15. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that ſaith he hath no ſin, deceiveth himſelf and is a Lyar,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. and alſo that it's true that whoſoever is born of God doth not commit Sin, for his Seed, i. e. Chriſt's the new ſpiritual Nature remaineth in him, and he can't ſin becauſe he is <hi>born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. It is true that we are weak and nothing, and yet ſtrong and able to <hi>do all things,</hi> 2. Cor. 12.10, 11. Phil. 4.13. It's true that Believers are dead becauſe of Sin, but alive becauſe of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. and that when they dye by a natural Death, they ſhall never dye, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25, 26. They are Sons that have the Inheritance by their Birth-right, and yet in ſome reſpects may differ nothing from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and ſo they may be under the Law in a ſenſe, and yet under Grace, and Heirs according to the free Promiſe at the ſame time, <hi>Gal</hi> 4.1, 2. They are redeemed from the Curſe of the Law, and have forgiveneſs of Sins, and a Promiſe that God will never be wroth with them, nor rebuke them any more, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.9. And yet on the contrary, the Curſe written in the Law, is ſometimes poured out upon them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9, 11. and they have need ſtill to pray that God would deliver them from their Guiltineſs, and forgive their Debts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. and they may expect that God will puniſh them for all ther Iniquities, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. Theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96243:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>things aſſerted concerning Believers in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, do ſufficiently manifeſt that they partake of two contrary States in this Life; and this is a plain, and eaſie and ready way to reconcile theſe ſeeming Contradictions, whatever other ways may be uſed to reconcile ſome of them. And what reaſon is there to queſtion that the old Sate remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Believers in ſome degrees, ſeeing all ſound Proteſtants acknowledge that the ſinful Deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Pollution of our Natures, commonly called <hi>Original Sin,</hi> which is one principal part of this old State, doth remain in all as long as they live in this World? Now though ſome penal Evils may be ſaid to remain in us, yet we can't ſuppoſe that this original Pollution is continued in us, and conſidered in Chriſt. But as conſidered in our old State derived from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed in ſome reſpect, even to thoſe that are juſtifyed by Faith, and they remain in a meaſure as aforeſaid, under the Puniſhment and Curſe denounced, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>in the day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye;</hi> and on this account the ſame original Guilt and Pollution is propagated to the Children of believing Parents, as well as others by natural Generation; and if ſuch a great and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental part of the natural State continue in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as ſubjection to the Guilt of the firſt Sin and original Corruption, which is one great part of the Puniſhment and Death threatned, and by which we are prone and inclined to all actual Sins, why ſhould we not judge that other parts of the ſame State, do likewiſe continue in them as well as the guilt of their own actual Sins, and ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Wrath of God and the Curſes and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments denounced againſt them in the Law?
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:96243:131"/>and why ſhould we not judge that all the Miſeries of this Life, and Death it ſelf, are inſlicted upon Believers, at leaſt in ſome reſpect, as Puniſhments of Sin? It may be objected that this Doctrin of a twofold State of Believers in this Life, doth much derogate from the Perfection of our Juſtification by Chriſt, and from the fulneſs of all the Grace and ſpiritual Bleſſings of Chriſt, and from the Merits of his Death and the power of his Spirit; and that it greatly diminiſheth the Conſolation of Believers in Chriſt. But it may be eaſily vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from this Objection, if we underſtand it rightly; for notwithſtanding this twofold State, it ſtill holdeth true, that Believers while they are on Earth, have all Perfection of ſpiritual Bleſſings, Juſtification, Adoption, the Gift of the Spirit, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Eternal Life and Glory, in and with Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. in the perſon of Chriſt who is now in Heaven, the Old Man is perfectly crucifyed; they are dead to Sin and to the Law and its Curſe, and they are quickned together with him, and raiſed up with him, and made to ſit in heavenly Places, in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6, 7. and Believers do in their own perſons, receive and enjoy by Faith, all theſe perfect, ſpiritual Bleſſings of Chriſt, as far as they receive and enjoy Chriſt himſelf dwelling in them, and no further. Thus far they are in a new State free from the Guilt, Pollution and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin, and ſo from the Wrath of God and all Miſeries, and Death it ſelf, while they are in this World: Yea, all the Guilt, Pollution and Puniſhments of Sin and all Evils whatſoever, which they are ſubject to according to their natural State, do them no harm according to this new State, but work for their good, and are no Evils, but
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:96243:132"/>rather Advantages to them, tending to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction only of the Fleſh, and to the Perfection of the New Man in Chriſt. Yet it holdeth true alſo that our reception and enjoyment of Chriſt himſelf and all his Perfections, is but in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect meaſure and degree, until Faith be turned into heavenly Viſion and Fruition of Chriſt; and therefore our old ſinful State with the Evils there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is not perfectly aboliſhed during this Life. The Kingdom of Heaven, or the Grace of Chriſt within us, is like leaven in Meal, and doth not unite it ſelf perfectly to the Meal in an Inſtant, but by degrees, until <hi>the whole be leavened,</hi> Mat. 13.35. or <hi>like the morning Light that expelleth Darkneſs by degrees, ſhining more and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. This cannot be juſtly accounted any derogation to the Merits of Chriſt's Death, or to the power of his Spirit, ſeeing Chriſt never intended to bring to paſs by his Death, or by the power of his Spirit, that we ſhould enjoy his ſpiritual Bleſſings any further than we are in him, and enjoy him by Faith; or that we ſhould be made holy or happy according to the Fleſh, by a Reformation of our natural State, as hath been ſhewed: Neither doth this diminiſh the Conſolation of Believers in Chriſt, for thereby they may know that they have the Perfection of Grace and Happineſs in Chriſt, and that they enjoy it in this World, as far as they enjoy Chriſt himſelf by Faith; and that they ſhall enjoy it in a perfect meaſure, and be fully freed from their old Sins and miſerable State, when that frame of Nature which they received from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> is diſſolved by Death. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is very uſeful to frame our Souls aright
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96243:132"/>for the practiſing of Holineſs, only by thoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Principles and Means that belong to our new State, which we are Partakers of by Faith in Chriſt. And thus it is eaſily vindicated from another great Objection, wherein the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> do much Triumph. They appeal to Mens Conſcience to anſwer this Queſtion, which Doctrin is moſt likely to bring People to the practice of true Godlineſs, theirs which teacheth, <hi>That perfect Holineſs may be attained in this Life,</hi> or ours which teacheth, <hi>That it is impoſſible for us to keep the Law perfectly, and to purge our ſelves from all Sin as long as we live in this World, though we uſe our best Endeavours?</hi> They think that common Reaſon will make the Verdict paſs for them againſt our Doctrin, as that which diſcourageth all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for Perfection, and hardneth the Hearts of People to allow themſelves in Sin becauſe they cannot avoid it. But on the contrary, the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Perfection hardens People to allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Sin, and to call Evil Good, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> account, <hi>That the Concupiſcence of the Fleſh againſt the Spirit is no Sin, but rather good matter for the Exerciſe of their Vertues, becauſe the most perfect in this Life, are not without it:</hi> It alſo diſcourageth thoſe that labour to get Holineſs in the right way, by Faith in Chriſt, and maketh them to think that they labour in vain, becauſe they find themſelves ſtill ſinful, and far from Perfection, when they have done their beſt to attain it. It hindereth our Diligence in ſeeking Holineſs, by theſe Principles and Means, whereby only it can be found: For who will be Diligent and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to avoid walking according to his own carnal Principles, if he think that his own carnal State
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:96243:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>with it's Principles, is quite aboliſhed, and is out of him, ſo that at preſent he is in no danger of walking according to them? Whatſoever good works the Doctrin of the <hi>Perfectioniſts</hi> may ſerve to promote, I am ſure it hindereth a great part of that work which Chriſt would have us to be employed in as long as we live in this World; we muſt know that our old State with its evil Principles, continueth ſtill in a meaſure, or elſe we ſhall not be ſit for the great Duties of confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sins, loathing our ſelves for them, praying earneſtly for the Pardon of them, a juſt ſorrowing for them with a Godly Sorrow, accepting the Puniſhment of our Sins, and giving God the glory of his Juſtice, and offering to him the Sacrifice of a broken and contrite Spirit, being poor in Spirit, working out our Salvation with fear and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Some have doubted how it can conſiſt with our Juſtification by Chriſt, that we ſhould be ſtill lyable to be puniſhed for our Sins, and obliged to pray for the Pardon of them, becauſe they have not well conſidered the twofold State of Believers in this Life; and except we know this and keep it in Mind, we ſhall never be ſit to practiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually the great Duties that tend to the putting off the Old Man and putting on the New Man, and mortifying the Deeds of the Body by the Spirit, praying continually that God would renew a right Spirit in us and ſanctify us throughout; preſſing forward to Perfection, deſiring the ſincere Milk of the Word and the Enjoyment of other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Chriſt hath appointed that his Church on Earth, ſhould be employed in ſuch works; and <hi>Perfectioniſts</hi> either do, or ſain would account them needleſs for them, and that they have no
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96243:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>longer need of Chriſt himſelf, to be their ſpiritual Phyſician and Advocate with the Father, and Propitiation for their Sins: Therefore they are not fit to be Members of the Church on Earth, and are never likely to be Members of the Church in Heaven, except they can make a Ladder and climb up thither before their time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Deſpair of purging the Fleſh or Natural Man of its ſinful Luſts and Inclinations, and of practiſing Holineſs, by <hi>your</hi> willing and reſolving to do the beſt that lyeth in <hi>your own</hi> Power, and truſting on the Grace of God and Chriſt to help you in ſuch Reſolutions and Endeavours; rather reſolve to truſt on Chriſt to work in you to will and to do by <hi>his own power,</hi> according to his own good Pleaſure. They that are convinced of their own Sin and Miſery, do commonly firſt think <hi>to tame the</hi> Fleſh, and to ſubdue and root out its Luſts, and to make their corrupt Nature to be better na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, and inclined to Holineſs by their ſtrugling and wreſtling with it: And if they can but bring their Hearts to a full purpoſe and reſolution to do the beſt that lyeth in them, they hope that by ſuch a Reſolution, they ſhall be able to atchieve great Enterprizes in the Conqueſt of their Luſts, and performance of the moſt difficult Duties. It is the great work of ſome zealous Divines, in their Preaching and Writings, to ſtir up People to this Reſolution, wherein they place the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt turning Point from Sin to Godlineſs. And they think that this is not contrary to the life of Faith, becauſe they truſt on the Grace of God through Chriſt, to help them in all ſuch Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Endeavours. Thus they endeavour to reform their old State, and to be made perfect in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96243:134"/>the Fleſh, inſtead of putting it off, and walking according to the new State in Chriſt. They truſt on low, carnal things for Holineſs, and upon the acts of their own Will, their Purpoſes, Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Endeavours, inſtead of Chriſt; and they truſt to Chriſt to help them in this carnal way, whereas true Faith would teach them that they are nothing, and that they do but labour in vain. They may as well waſh a Blackamoor white, as purge the Fleſh or Natural Man from its evil Luſts, and make it pure and holy. It is deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wicked, paſt all cure: It will unavoidably luſt againſt the Spirit of God, even in the beſt Saints on Earth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 17. <hi>its mind is enmity to the Law of God, and neither is, nor can be ſubject to it,</hi> Rom. 8.7. They that would cure it and make it holy by their own Reſolutions and Endeavours, do act quite contrary to the deſign of Chriſt's Death, for he dyed not that the Fleſh, or Old Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Man might be made holy, but that it might be crucifyed and deſtroyed out of us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. and that we might live to God, not to our ſelves, or by any natural power of our own Reſolutions or Endeavours, but by Chriſt living in us, and by his Spirit bringing forth the fruits of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and 5.24, 25. Therefore we muſt be content to leave the Natural Man vile and wicked, as we found it, until it be utterly aboliſhed by Death, though we muſt not allow its Wickedneſs, but rather groan to be delivered from the Body of this Death, thanking God that there is a Deliverance through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Our way to mortify ſinful Affections and Luſts, muſt be not by purging them out of the Fleſh, but by putting off the Fleſh it ſelf, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96243:134"/>above into Chriſt by Faith, and walking in that new Nature that is by him; thus <hi>the way of Life is above to the Wiſe, that he may depart from Hell beneath,</hi> Prov. 15.24. <hi>Our willing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving</hi> and endeavouring, muſt be to do the beſt, not that lyeth in our ſelves, or in our own power, but that Chriſt and the power of his Spirit ſhall be pleaſed to work in us, for in us <hi>i. e. in our Fleſh there dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. we have no ground to truſt in God and Chriſt for help in ſuch Reſolutions and Endeavours, as in things that are agreeable to the deſign of Chriſt in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption as to the way of acting and living by Faith. It is likely that <hi>Peter</hi> ſincerely reſolved to dye with Chriſt, rather than to deny him, and to do all that he could by his own power for that end; but Chriſt made him quickly to ſee the Weakneſs and Vanity of ſuch Reſolutions, and we ſee by Experience, what many Reſolutions made in Sickneſs and other Dangers moſtly come to. It is not enough for us to truſt on Chriſt to help us to act and endeavour ſo far only as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for ſo the worſt of Men are helped; he is the <hi>Jehovah</hi> in <hi>whom they Live, Move, and have their Being;</hi> Act. 17.28. and it's likely the <hi>Phariſee</hi> would truſt on God to help him in Duty, as he would thank God for the performance of Duty, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. and this is all the Faith that many make uſe of to a holy Practice: But we muſt truſt on Chriſt to enable us above the ſtrength of our own natural power, by vertue of the new Nature which we have in Chriſt, and by his Spirit dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working in us; or elſe our beſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will be altogether ſinful, and meer Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, notwithſtanding all the help for which we truſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96243:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon him. We muſt alſo take heed of depending for Holineſs upon any Reſolutions to walk in Chriſt, or on any written Covenants or any Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that we have already received; for we muſt know that the Vertue of theſe things, continue no longer than we continue walking in Chriſt and Chriſt in us: They muſt be kept up by the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Preſence of Chriſt in us, as Light is maintained by the preſence of the Sun, and cannot ſubſiſt without it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt not ſeek to procure forgiveneſs of ſins, the favour of God, a new holy Nature, Life, and Happineſs, by any works of the Moral Law, or by any Rites and Ceremonies whatever; but rather, you muſt work as thoſe that have all theſe things already according to your new ſtate in Chriſt; as ſuch who are only to receive them more and more by Faith, as they are ready prepared and treaſured up for you, and freely given to you by your <hi>ſpiritual head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If we walk as thoſe that are yet wholly to ſeek for the procurement of ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments as theſe, it is a manifeſt ſign, that at preſent, we judge our ſelves to be without them, and without Chriſt himſelf; in whoſe fulneſs they are all contained: And therefore we walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our own Natural State, as thoſe that are yet in the Fleſh, and that would get Salvation in it, and by our carnal Works and Obſervances, inſtead of living altogether on Chriſt by Faith. This practice is according to the tenour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, as I have before ſhewed. And we have no ground to truſt on Chriſt and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to work Holineſs in us this way; for we are dead to the Legal Covenant by the <hi>Body of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:96243:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>Rom. 7. And if we be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> we are not <hi>under the Law,</hi> Gal. 5.18. When the <hi>Galatians</hi> were ſeduced by falſe Teachers, to ſeek the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of Juſtification and Life by Circumciſion, and other works of the Moſaical Law, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> rebuketh them for ſeeking to be made <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the fleſh,</hi> directly contrary to their good <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Spirit,</hi> for rendring <hi>Chriſt of none effect to them,</hi> and for <hi>falling from Grace,</hi> Gal. 3.3. and 5.4. And when ſome of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſought perfection in the like manner, by obſervation of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, holy-meats, holy-times, and other Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the World; The ſame Apoſtle blameth them for not holding the <hi>Head Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and as ſuch as were not <hi>dead and riſen with Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>living merely in the World,</hi> Col. 2.19, 20. and 3.1. He clearly ſheweth, that thoſe who ſeek any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enjoyments in ſuch a way, do walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own Natural State: And that the true manner of living by Faith in Chriſt, is to walk as thoſe that have all fulneſs and perfection of Spiritual Bleſſings in Chriſt by Faith, and need not ſeek for them any other way to procure them for themſelves. In this ſenſe it is a true ſaying, That Believers ſhould not act for Life, but from Life. They muſt act as thoſe that are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Life by their Works, but as ſuch who have already received and derived <hi>Life from Chriſt,</hi> and act from the Power and Vertue received from him. And hereby it appears, that the Papiſts, and all others that think to Juſtifie, Puriſie, Sanctifie, and ſave themſelves by any of their own Works, Rites or Ceremonies whatever, do walk in a carnal way, as thoſe that are without any preſent intereſt in Chriſt, and ſhall never attain unto Holineſs or
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96243:136"/>Happineſs, until they learn a better way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Think not that you can effectually encline your Heart to the immediate practice of Holineſs, by any ſuch practical Principles, as do only ſerve to bind, preſs and urge you to the performance of holy Duties: But rather let ſuch Principles ſtir you up to go to Chriſt firſt by Faith, that you may be effectually enclined to the immediate practice of Holineſs in him by Goſpel Principles, that ſtrengthen and enable you, as well as oblige you thereunto. There are ſome practical Principles, that do only bind, preſs, and urge us to holy Duties, by ſhewing the reaſonableneſs, equity, and neceſſity of our Obedience, without ſhewing at all, how we that are by Nature <hi>dead in ſin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wrath of God,</hi> may have any Strength and Ability for the performance of them. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the Authority of God the Law-giver; our abſolute dependance on him as our Creator, Preſerver, Governour, in whoſe hand is our Life, Breath, and all our Happineſs here and for ever. His All-feeing Eye, that ſearcheth our Heart, diſcerneth our very Thoughts and ſecret Purpoſes, his exact Juſtice, in <hi>rendring to all according to their works;</hi> his Almighty and Eternal Power to reward thoſe that Obey him, and to puniſh tranſgreſſors for ever, The <hi>unſpeakable Joy of Heaven,</hi> and <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Damnation of Hell.</hi> Such Principles as theſe do bind our Conſciences very ſtrictly, and do work very ſtrongly upon the prevalent Affections of Hope and Fear, to proſs and urge our Hearts to the performance of holy Duties, if we believe them aſſuredly, and work them earneſtly upon our Hearts, by frequent, ſerious, lively Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:96243:136"/>And therefore ſome account them moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and effectual means to form any Vertue in the Soul, and to bring it to immediate perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of any Duty, tho never ſo difficult; and that the Life of Faith conſiſteth principally in our living to God in Holineſs, by a conſtant Belief and Meditation on them. And they account thoſe things that ſerve to mind them of ſuch Principles very effectual for Holineſs, as looking on the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Death, or on a Deaths-head, keeping a Coffin by them ready made, walking about among the Graves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this is not that manner of living to God, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt that liveth in me; and the Life that I live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi> If a Man make uſe of theſe obliging Principles, to ſtir him to go to Chriſt for Strength to Act holily, he walketh like one that hath received Chriſt as his only Life by Faith, otherwiſe he walketh like other Natural Men. For the Natural Man may be brought to Act by theſe Principles, partly by Natural Light, and more fully by Scripture-Light, without any true knowledge of the way of Salvation by Chriſt, and as if Chriſt had never come into the World. And he may be ſtrictly bound by them, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently urged and preſſed to holy Duties; and yet all this while is left to his own Natural Strength or Weakneſs, being not aſſured by any of theſe Principles, that God will give him Strength to help him in the performance of theſe Duties; and can do nothing aright, until he get new Life and Strength in Chriſt by a more precious ſaving Faith. There would be no need of a new Life
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96243:137"/>and Strength by Chriſt, if theſe Principles were ſufficient to bring us to a holy Converſation. Therefore this manner of practice is no better than <hi>walking after the fleſh,</hi> according to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſtate, and a ſeeking to be made perfect in the fleſh. No queſtion but <hi>Paul</hi> was very diligent in it while he was a blind Phariſee. Yea, the Heathen Philoſophers might attain to it in ſome meaſure by the Light of Common Reaſon. The Devils have ſuch Principles, as they do believe aſſuredly, yet they are never the better for them. Its a part of that Natural Wiſdom whereby the world knew not God; not that Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery diſcovered in the Goſpel, which is the only ſanctifying Wiſdom and Power of God unto Salvation. VVhat can you produce but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, by preſſing with Motives to Holineſs, one that hath no <hi>ſoundneſs in him, from the ſole of the foot even to the head, only wounds and bruiſes, and putrified ſores.</hi> He that is made truly ſenſible of his own vileneſs and deadneſs by Nature, will deſpair of ever bringing himſelf to Holineſs by Principles that afford him no Life and Strength, but only lay an Obligation upon him, and urge and preſs him to Duty. What are meer Obligations to one that is dead in ſin? While the Soul is without ſpiritual Life, ſin is the more moved and enraged, by preſſing and urging upon the Soul the Obligations of the Law, and its Commands. The motions of ſin are by the Law, and <hi>ſin taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion by the Commandment, worketh in us all manner of Concupiſcence,</hi> Rom. 7.5, 7, 8. And yet theſe obliging Principles are very good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in this right Goſpel uſe of them, as the Apoſtle ſaith of the Law, that it is <hi>good, if it be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96243:137"/>uſed lawfully,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.7. The humbled ſinner knoweth well his Obligations; but it is Life and Strength that he wanteth, and deſpaireth of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to ſuch Obligations, until he get this Life and Strength by Faith in Chriſt: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe obliging Principles do move him to go in the firſt place to Chriſt, that ſo he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to anſwer their End, by the ſtrengthning and enlivening Principles of Gods Grace in Chriſt. Some there are, that make uſe of Goſpel-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples only to oblige and urge to Duty, without affording any Life and Strength for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, <hi>as they that think, that Chriſt dyed and roſe again to eſtabliſh a New Covenant of Works for our Salvation,</hi> and to give us a pattern of Good Works by his own Obedience, rather than to purchaſe Life, Obedience, and good Works for us. Such as theſe do not underſtand, and receive the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Goſpel rightly; but they pervert and abuſe them, contrary to their true Nature and Deſign; and thereby they render them as ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual for their Sanctification, as any other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or legal Principles.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Stir up and ſtrengthen your ſelf to perform the Duties of Holineſs, by a firm perſwaſion of your enjoyment of Jeſus Chriſt, and all ſpiritual and everlaſting Benefits through him. Set not your ſelves upon the performance of the Law with any prevailing thoughts or apprehenſions, that you are yet without an Intereſt in Chriſt, and the love of God through him, under the <hi>Curſe of the Law,</hi> the <hi>power of Sin and Satan,</hi> having no better Portion than this preſent World; no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrength, than that which is in the purpoſes and reſolutions of your own Free-will. While
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:96243:138"/>ſuch thoughts as theſe prevail, and influence your Actings, its evident that you walk according to the Principles and Practices of your <hi>old natural ſtate;</hi> and you will be moved thereby to yield to the Dominion of Sin and Satan, to withdraw your ſelves from God and Godlineſs, as <hi>Adam</hi> was moved from the ſight of his own Nakedneſs, to <hi>hide himſelf from God,</hi> Gen. 3.10. Therefore your way to a holy practice, is firſt to conquer and ſpoil ſuch unbelieving thoughts, by truſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently on Chriſt, and perſuading your ſelves by Faith, that his Righteouſneſs, Spirit, Glory, and all his ſpiritual Benefits are yours, and <hi>he dwelleth in you, and you in him.</hi> In the might of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence you ſhould go forth to the performance of the Law; and you will be ſtrong againſt Sin and Satan, and <hi>able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens you.</hi> This conſident perſwaſion is of great neceſſity to the right framing and diſpoſing our Hearts to walk according to our new ſtate in Chriſt. The Life of Faith principally conſiſteth in it. And herein it eminently appeareth, that Faith is an Hand not only to receive Chriſt, but alſo to work by him; and that it cannot be effectual for our Sanctification, except it contain in it ſome Aſſurance of our Intereſt in Chriſt, as hath bin ſhewed. Thus we act as thoſe that are above the Sphear of Nature, advanced to Union and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt. The Apoſtle maintained in his Heart, a perſwaſion that Chriſt had <hi>loved him,</hi> and given himſelf for him; and hereby he was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to live to God in Holineſs, through Chriſt living in him by Faith. He teacheth us alſo, that we muſt maintain the like perſwaſion, if we would walk holily in Chriſt. We muſt know, that our <hi>old man
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:96243:138"/>is crucified with him;</hi> and we muſt reckon our ſelves <hi>dead indeed unto ſin, and alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6.6. This is the means whereby we may be <hi>filled with the Spirit, strong in the Lord, and the power of his might;</hi> which God would not require of us, if he had not appointed the means, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. Chriſt himſelf walked in a conſtant perſwaſion of his excellent ſtate; he ſet the Lord always before him, and was perſwaded, that becauſe God was at <hi>his right hand,</hi> he ſhould not he moved, <hi>Pſal</hi> 16.8. How ſhould it be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally expected, that a Man ſhould Act according to this new ſtate, without Aſſurance that he is in it? Its a rule of Common Prudence in all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Callings and Conditions, that every one muſt know and conſider well his own State, leſt he ſhould act proudly above it, or ſordidly below it; and it is a hard thing to bring ſome to a right eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of their own worldly Conditions. If the ſame rule were obſerved in Spiritual things, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the knowledg and perſwaſion of the Glory and Excellency of our new ſtate in Chriſt, would more elevate the hearts of Believers above all ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Salvery to their Luſts, and enlarge them to run chearfully the ways of Gods Commandments: If Chriſtians knew their own Strength better, they would enterprize greater things for the Glory of God. This Knowledge is difficultly attained, it is only by Faith and ſpiritual Illumination; the beſt know but in part, and hence it is that the Converſation of Believers, falleth ſo much below their holy and heavenly Calling.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider what Endowments, Priviledges or Properties of your new State are moſt meet, and forcible to incline and ſtrengthen your Heart to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:96243:139"/>love God above all, and to renounce all Sin, and to give up your ſelf to Univerſal Obedience to his Commands, and ſtrive to walk in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of them, that you may attain to the Practice of theſe great Duties<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I may well joyn theſe together, becauſe to love the Lord with all our Hearts, Might and Soul, is the firſt and great Commandment which influenceth us to all Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with a hatred and deteſtation of all Sin as it's contrary and hateful to God. The ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means that produceth the one, will alſo produce the other, and Holineſs chiefly conſiſteth in theſe. So the chief Bleſſings of our holy State are moſt meet and forcible to enable us for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate performance of them, and are to be made uſe of to this end by Faith. Particularly you muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſtedfaſtly that all your Sins are blotted out, and that you are reconciled to God, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs into his Favour by the Blood of Chriſt, and that he is your God and Father, and altogether Love to you, and your all-ſufficient everlaſting Portion and Happineſs through Chriſt. Such Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions as theſe, do preſent God as a very lovely Object to our Hearts, and do thereby allure and win our Affections that cannot be forced by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or Threatnings, but muſt be ſweetly won and drawn by Allurements. We muſt not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any Suſpicions that God will prove a terrible, everlaſting Enemy to us, if we would love him; <hi>for there is no fear in Love, but perfect Love caſteth out Fear, becauſe Fear hath Torment; he that feareth is not made perfect in Love, we love him becauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.18, 19. <hi>David</hi> loved the Lord becauſe he was perſuaded that he was his Strength, Rock, Fortreſs, his God
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96243:139"/>
                  <hi>and the horn of his ſalvation,</hi> Pſal. 18.1, 2. Love that cauſeth Obedience unto the Law, muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a good Conſcience, purged from ſin; and this good Conſcience muſt proceed from <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> whereby we apprehend the <hi>remiſſion of our ſins,</hi> our Reconciliation with God by the <hi>merits of the blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. <hi>with</hi> Heb. 9.14. For the ſame end that your Hearts may be rightly fitted and framed for the performance of theſe principal Duties, the Holy Scripture directeth you to walk in the perſwaſion of other principal Endowments of your new ſtate: As, that <hi>you have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.3. That you are the <hi>Temple of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16. That you <hi>live by the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.25. That you are <hi>called to Holineſs, and created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works:</hi> That God will <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſie you wholly, and make you perfect in holineſs at the laſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23, 24. Eph. 2.10. That your <hi>old man is crucified with Chriſt;</hi> and through him <hi>you are dead unto ſin, and alive unto God; and being made free from ſin, you are become the Servants of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and have your Fruit unto Holineſs, and the End Everlaſting Life,</hi> Rom. 6.6, 22. You are Dead, <hi>and your Life is hid with Chriſt in God. When Chriſt who is your Life ſhall appear, then ſhall you alſo appear with him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3.3, 4. Such perſwaſions as theſe, when they are deeply rooted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintained in our Hearts, do ſtrongly Arm and Encourage us to practiſe Univerſal Obedience in oppoſition to every ſinful Luſt: Becauſe we look upon it not only as our Duty, but our great Priviledge, <hi>to do all things through Chriſt ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of us;</hi> and God doth certainly work in us <hi>both to will and to do</hi> by theſe Principles, becauſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:96243:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>they properly belong to the Goſpel, or New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which is the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit, and the Power of God unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6, 8. Rom. 1.16.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the performance of other Duties of the Law, you are to conſider not only theſe Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Priviledges and Properties of their new State, which are meet and forcible, to enable you to the Love of God, and Univerſal Obedience, but alſo thoſe that have a peculiar force and aptitude ſuitable to the ſpecial Nature of ſuch Duties: And you muſt endeavour to aſſure your ſelves of them by Faith, that you may be encouraged and ſtrengthned to perform the Duties. I ſhall give you ſome inſtances of this manner of practice in ſeveral Duties, whereby you may the better underſtand how to guide your ſelves in the reſt. And as to the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt Table, if you would draw near to God in a Duty of his Worſhip with a true Heart, you muſt do it in full aſſurance of Faith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your enjoyment of Chriſt, and his Salvation. And would you perform the great Duty of truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Lord with all your Heart, eaſting your Care upon him, and committing the diſpoſal of your ſelf to him in all your Concerns? Perſwade your ſelf through Chriſt, that God, according to his Promiſe, <hi>will never fail you, nor forſake you;</hi> that he taketh a <hi>Fatherly Care of you,</hi> that he will <hi>with-hold no good thing from you,</hi> and will make all <hi>things to work for your Good:</hi> And thus you will be ſtrong and couragious in the practice of this Duty: Whereas, if you live in a meer ſuſpence concerning your Intereſt in the Priviledges, you will be ſubject to <hi>carnal fears, carping cares,</hi> in deſpite of your Heart, and you willbe prone to truſt on the Arm of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96243:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>Fleſh, tho your Conſcience tell you plainly, that in ſo doing you incur the hainous guilt of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Would you be ſtrengthned to ſubmit to the hand of God with a chearful Patience, in bearing any Affliction, and Death it ſelf? The way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie your ſelves, is to Believe aſſuredly, that your <hi>Afflictions that are but for a moment, do work for you a far more exceeding eternal weight of Glory;</hi> that Chriſt is <hi>your gain in death and life;</hi> that his <hi>Grace is ſufficient for you;</hi> and his <hi>ſtrength made perfect in your weakneſs;</hi> and that he <hi>will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able;</hi> and will at <hi>laſt make you more than Conquerours over all evil.</hi> Until you attain to ſuch perſwaſions as theſe, you will be prone to fret, and murmur under the burden of Affliction, and to uſe indirect means to deliver your ſelves, notwithſtanding the cleareſt Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the contrary. Would you limit your ſelves to the Obſervation of Gods own Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Worſhip? Believe that you are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat in Chriſt, and have all perfection of ſpiritual Bleſſings in him; and that God will build you up in Chriſt by the Ordinances of his own Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This will make you account his Ordinances ſufficient, and Mens Traditions, and Inventions, needleſs in the Worſhip of God: Whereas if you do not apprehend all fulneſs in Chriſt, you will be like the Papiſts, prone to catch at every Straw, and to multiply Superſtitious Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without end, for the ſupply of your ſpiritual Wants. Would you confeſs your ſins to God, pray to him, and praiſe him heartily for his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits? Would you praiſe him for Afflictions as well as Proſperity? Believe aſſuredly that God is Faithful and Juſt to forgive your ſin through Chriſt,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96243:141"/>that you are made an Holy Prieſthood, to offer ſpiritual Sacriſices of Prayer and Praiſes, that are acceptable to God through Chriſt; and that God heareth your Prayers, and will fulfill them ſo far as they are good for you; and that all Gods ways are Mercy and Truth toward you, whether he proſper or afflict you in this life. If you be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in doubt, or otherwiſe perſwaded concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Priviledges, all your Confeſſions, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Praiſes, will be but heartleſs, Lip-labours, Slaviſh or Phariſaical Works. In like manner you will be enabled to hear and receive the Word as the Word of God, and to meditate on it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and you will be willing to know the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſpirituality of the Commands of God, and to try and examine your ways impartially by them, <hi>if you believe aſſuredly</hi> that the Word is the Power of God to Salvation; and that Chriſt is your great Phyſician, <hi>willing and able to heal you, be the caſe never ſo bad:</hi> And where your ſin abounds, his <hi>Grace towards you doth ſo much the more abound:</hi> Whereas, without theſe Comfortable Apprehenſions, all the works of Hearing, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Self-examination, will be but uncouth heartleſs Works, and they will be performed negligently, and by halves, or hypocritically, and out of ſlaviſh Fear, with much reluctancy, without any good will, or readineſs of mind. So alſo for the right receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sacraments, you will find your ſelves much ſtrengthned by Believing, that you may have Communion with God and Chriſt in them, and that you have a great High-Prieſt to <hi>bear the Iniquity of your holy things,</hi> and to make you for ever <hi>accepted before the Lord.</hi> In the ſame way
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:96243:141"/>you are to apply your ſelves to all Duties towards your Neighbour, required in the ſecond Table of the Law, by Acting in a perſwaſion of ſuch priviledges of your new Eſtate, as have a peculiar force to encourage and ſtrengthen you for the performance of them. That you may <hi>love your Neighbour as your ſelf, and do to him in all things as you would he ſhould do to you, without partiality and ſelf-ſeeking; that you may give him his due Honour, and abstain from injuring him in his Life, Chaſtity, worldly Estate, good Name, or from Coveting any thing that is his, according to the ſeveral Commands in the ſecond Table of the Decalogue:</hi> You muſt walk in a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not only that theſe things are juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table toward your Fellow-Creatures, and that you are ſtrictly bound to the performance of them, but that they are the <hi>will of your heavenly Father, that hath begotten you according to his own Image in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, and hath given you his Spirit, that you may be like-minded to him in all things:</hi> And that they are the <hi>mind of Chriſt who dwelleth in you, and you in him:</hi> That God and Chriſt are kind, tender-hearted, long-ſuffering, full of goodneſs to Men, whether good or bad, Friends or Enemies, Poor or Rich; and that Chriſt came into the World, <hi>not to deſtroy, but to ſave;</hi> and that you are of the ſame Spirit; that the Injuries done to you by your Neighbours can do you no harm: And you need not ſeek any good for your ſelves by injuring them, becauſe you have all deſirable happineſs in Chriſt; and all things, tho intended by your Enemies for your hurt, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly work for your good through Chriſt: Such apprehenſions as theſe, wrought in us by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faith, do certainly beget in us a right frame
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:96243:142"/>of Spirit, throughly furniſhed for every good work towards our Neighbour. Likewiſe, your Hearts will be <hi>purified to unfeigned love of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt,</hi> and you will walk toward them with all <hi>lowlineſs, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in Love, if you maintain a ſtedfaſt belief and perſwaſion of thoſe manifold Bonds of Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you are inſeparably joyned with them through Christ;</hi> as particularly, <hi>that there is one Body, and one Spirit, one hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. Finally, you will be able to abſtain from all fleſhly and worldly Luſts, that war againſt the Soul, and hinder all Godlineſs, by an aſſured perſwaſion; not meerly that Gluttony, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs, Letchery, are filthy Swiniſh Abominations; And that the pleaſures, profits, and honours of the World are vain, empty things; but that you are Crucified to the Fleſh, and the World, and quickned, raiſed and ſet in heavenly places through Christ; and that you have pleaſures, profits, honours in Chriſt, to which the beſt things in the World are not worthy to be compared: And that you are Members of Chriſt, the Temple of his Spirit, Citizens of Heaven, Children of the Day, not of the Night, nor of Darkneſs.</hi> So that 'tis below your State and Dignity to practiſe <hi>deeds of darkneſs,</hi> and mind <hi>fleſhly worldly things.</hi> Thus I have given Inſtances enough to ſtir you up to acquaint your ſelves with the manifold endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, priviledges, properties of your New State in Chriſt, as they are diſcovered in the Goſpel of your Salvation, whereby the new Nature is fitted for holy Operations; as the common Nature of Man is furniſhed with the Endowments neceſſary for thoſe Functions and Operations to which it
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:96243:142"/>is deſigned; and alſo to ſtir you up to make uſe of them by Faith, as they ſerve to ſtrengthen you either for Univerſal Obedience, or for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duties: And by this manner of Walking, your Hearts will be comforted and eſtabliſhed in every good Word and Work, and you will grow in Holineſs, until you attain to Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="8">8. If you endeavour to grow in Grace and in all Holineſs, truſt aſſuredly that God will enable you by this manner of Walking, to do every thing that is neceſſary for his Glory and your own ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation, and that he will graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that Obedience through Chriſt, which you are enabled to perform according to the meaſure of your Faith, and pardon your Failings, though you offend in many things, and fall ſhort of many others, as to degrees of Holineſs and high Acts of Obedience. And therefore attempt not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Duty in any other way, though you cannot yet attain to do ſo much as you would in this way. This is a neceſſary Inſtruction to eſtabliſh us in the life of Faith, that the ſenſe of our mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Failings and Defects, may not move us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their to Deſpair, or to return to the uſe of carnal Principles and Means, for help againſt our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, as accounting this way of living and acting by Faith, to be in-ſufficient for our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and Salvation. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> exhorts the <hi>Galatians</hi> to walk in the Spirit; <hi>though the fleſh luſts againſt the ſpirit, ſo that they cannot do the things that they would,</hi> Gal. 5 10, 17. We are to know that though the Law requireth of us the utmoſt perfection of Holineſs, yet the Goſpel maketh an allowance for our Weakneſs, and Chriſt is ſo meek
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:96243:143"/>and lowly in heart, that he accepteth of that which our weak Faith can attain to by his Grace, and doth not exact or expect any more of us for his Glory and our Salvation, until we grow ſtronger in Grace. <hi>God ſhewed his great Indulgence to his People under the Old Testament, that</hi> Moſes <hi>the Law-giver ſuffered them, becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts to put away their Wives: Though from the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> Mat. 19.8. and alſo in tolerating the cuſtomary practice of Polygamy; tho Chriſt will not tolerate the continuance of ſuch Practices in his Church, ſince his Spirit is more plentifully poured forth under the Goſpel: Yet he is as forward as ever, to bear with the Failings of his weak Saints that deſire to obey him ſincerely. <hi>We have another Inſtance of God's Indulgence,</hi> more full to our preſent purpoſe, in his <hi>commanding</hi> that the <hi>fearful and faint-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ſhould not be forced to enter into the Battel againſt their Enemies, but ſuffered to <hi>return home to their Houſes:</hi> Though ſighting in Battel againſt Enemies, without Fear and Faint-heartedneſs, was a Duty that God did much exerciſe his People in, at that time, <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.3, 8. So un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, though it be an eminent part of Chriſt's Service, to endure the greateſt Fight of Afflictions and Death it ſelf, courageouſly for his Name ſake, yet if any be ſo weak in Faith that they have not ſufficient Courage to venture into the Battel, no doubt but Chriſt alloweth them to make uſe of any honeſt means, whereby they may eſcape the hands of Perſecutors with ſafety to their holy Profeſſion: He will accept them in this weaker kind of Service, and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them better than if they ſhould hazard
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96243:143"/>a denial of his Name, by venturing themſelves upon the Tryal of Martyrdom, when they might have eſcaped it. <hi>Peter</hi> came off with Sin and Shame, by <hi>venturing beyond the meaſure of his Faith,</hi> into the hands of his Perſecutors, when he went after Chriſt to the High Prieſt's Hall; whereas he ſhould rather have made uſe of that indulgent Diſmiſſion that Chriſt gave to him and the reſt of his Diſciples: <hi>Let theſe go their way,</hi> Joh. 18.8. Chriſt dealeth with his People as a good careful Shepherd, that will not over-drive his Sheep: <hi>He gathereth his Lambs with his Arms, and carrieth them in his Boſom, and will gently lead thoſe that are with young,</hi> Iſa. 40.11. He would not have his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples urged rigorouſly upon the Duty of Faſting, when their Spirits were unfit for it, becauſe he knew that impoſing Duties above their Strength, is like <hi>putting a piece of new Cloath into an old Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and new Wine into old Bottles;</hi> which ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all at laſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.14, 17. That Precept of <hi>Solomon, Be not righteous overmuch,</hi> Prov. 7.10. is very uſeful and neceſſary, if rightly underſtood. We are to beware of being too rigorous in exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs, of our ſelves and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the meaſure of Faith and Grace. Overdoing commonly proveth undoing. Children that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on their Feet beyond their Strength, have many a Fall; and ſo have Babes in Chriſt, when they venture unneceſſarily upon ſuch Duties as are beyond the ſtrength of their Faith. We ſhould be content at preſent to do the beſt that we can according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt, though we know that others are enabled to do much better; and we are not to deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, but to praiſe God that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96243:144"/>he worketh in us any thing that is well-pleaſing in his ſight, hoping that he will ſanctify us throughout, and bring us at laſt to perfection of Holineſs through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. And we ſhould carefully obſerve in all things, that good Leſſon of the Apoſtle, <hi>not to think of our ſelves more highly than we ought to think, but to think ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according as God hath dealt to every Man the meaſure of Faith,</hi> Rom. 12.3.</p>

Two things are obſervable in it: Firſt, That though all Holineſs be effectually attained unto
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96243:144"/>by the life of Faith in Chriſt, yet the uſe of any means appointed in the Word for attaining and promoting Holineſs, is not hereby made void, but rather eſtabliſhed. This is needful to be obſerved againſt the Pride and Ignorance of ſome carnal Goſpellers, that being puft up with a Conceit of their feigned Faith, imagine themſelves to be in ſuch a ſtate of Perfection, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Ordinances, except ſinging <hi>Halelujahs:</hi> And alſo againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> that run into the contrary Extream, by heaping together a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiude of means of Holineſs which God never commanded, neither ever came they into his Heart; and that Slander the Proteſtant Doctrin of Faith and Free Grace, as if it tended to deſtroy all diligent uſe of the means of Holineſs and Salvation, and to breed up a company of lazy Solifidians. We do indeed aſſert and profeſs that a true and lively Faith in Chriſt, is alone ſufficient and effectual through the Grace of God, to receive Chriſt and all his Fulneſs, ſo far as is neceſſary in this Life for our Juſtification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and eternal Salvation: But yet we alſo aſſert and profeſs, that ſeveral means are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, for the Begetting, Maintaining and Increaſing of this Faith, and the Acting and Exerciſing of it, in order to the attainment of its End; and that theſe means are to be uſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently which are mention'd in the Sequel.

                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:96243:145"/>John, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.30. yet we account no means neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or lawful to be uſed for the attainment of Holineſs, beſides they that are appointed by God in his Word. We know that Holineſs is <hi>a Part of</hi> our Salvation, and therefore they that think that Men may, or can invent any means effectual for the attainment of it, do aſcribe their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on partly to Men, and rob God of his Glory, in being our only Saviour; and they do thereby plainly ſhew, That though they <hi>draw nigh unto God with their mouth and honour him with their lips, yet their hearts are far from him; and in vain do they worſhip him, teaching for Doctrins, the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men,</hi> Mat. 15.7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>The Second thing obſervable and principally deſign'd in this Direction, is the right manner of uſing all the means of Holineſs, for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and practiſing of it in no other way, beſides that of believing in Chriſt, and walking in him accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our new State by Faith, which hath been already demonſtrated to be the only way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may effectually attain to this great End. We muſt uſe them as helps to the life of Faith, in its Beginning, Continuance and Growth; and as Inſtruments ſubſervient to Faith, the principal Inſtrument in all its Acts and Exerciſes whereby the Soul receiveth Chriſt, and walketh in all Holineſs, by him. We muſt beware leſt we uſe them rather in Oppoſition, than in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the way of Sanctification and Salvation by Free Grace in Chriſt, through Faith; and leſt by our Abuſe of them, they be made rather Hindrances, than Helps to our Faith. We muſt not Idolize any of the means, and put them into the place of Chriſt, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do <hi>by truſting
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:96243:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>in them;</hi> as if they were effectual to conferr Grace to the Soul, by the work that is done in the uſe of them. Neither may we uſe them as works of Righteouſneſs, to be performed as Conditions for the procuring of the Favour of God, and the Salvation of Chriſt: Neither muſt they be accounted ſo abſolutely neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if a true Faith were void and of none effect, when we are debarred from the Enjoyment of ſeveral of them. The holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with all the means of Grace appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, are <hi>able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> no other way than <hi>by faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.18. and therefore our wiſe Endeavour muſt be, not to uſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem in any oppoſition to the Grace of God in Chriſt. For God's Ordinances are like the Cherubims of Glory, made with their Faces looking towards the Mercy-Seat: They are made to guid us to Chriſt for Salvation by Faith alone. If any turn them to another uſe, it is a great Violation of divine Inſtitutions, as if any Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Perſon had preſumed to turn the Faces of the Cherubims from the Mercy-Seat ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. This right uſe of the means of Grace, is a Point wherein many are Ignorant, that uſe them with great Zeal and Diligence, and thereby they do not only loſe their Labour and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the means, but alſo they wreſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them to their own Deſtruction. The <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> enjoyed many more Ordinances of divine Worſhip than we do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel; but their Table became their Snare, and they fell miſerably from God and Chriſt, becauſe the Veil of Ignorance was upon
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:96243:146"/>their Hearts that they could not look to the end of thoſe Ordinances, even to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>And they ſought not ſalvation by faith, but by the ordinances as works of righteouſneſs, and by other works of the law; for they ſtumbled at the ſtumbling ſtone,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32; and 10.4, 5. 2 Cor. 3.13, 14. That you may not ſtumble and fall by the ſame pernicious Error, I ſhall ſhew particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how ſeveral of the principal means of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appointed in the Word of God, are to be made uſe of in that right manner expreſſed in the Direction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt endeavour diligently to know the Word of God contained in the Holy Scripture, and to improve it to this end, <hi>That we may be made wiſe unto Salvation through ſaith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. Other means of Salvation are neceſſary to the more abundant well-being of our Faith, and of our new State in Chriſt; but this is abſolutely neceſſary to the very being there of; becauſe Faith cometh by hearing the Word of God, and receiveth Chriſt as manifeſted by the Word, as I have before proved. <hi>Raab</hi> the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was juſtifyed by Faith, before ſhe had any viſible Commuion with the Church in any of God's Ordinances; yet not without the Word of God, even the ſame Word for Subſtance, which was written in the Scriptures, and was then extant in the Books of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Though that Word was not brought to her by any Book of Holy Scripture, nor by the Preaching of any Holy Miniſter, but by the Report of the Heathens, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.9, 11. But here our great work muſt be to get ſuch a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Word, as is neceſſary and ſufficient
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:96243:146"/>to guide us in receiving of Chriſt, and walking in him by Faith. You muſt not be of their Minds that think the Knowledge of the Ten Commandments, to be ſufficient to Salvation, or that would have Myſteries to remain hidden from the Underſtanding of the Vulgar, and nothing to be Preached to them but that they can readily aſſent to, and receive by the Light that is in all Men; of which Mind it may be ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are, who unwitingly agree with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in a Fundamental of their Hereſie. But you muſt endeavour chiefly to know the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery <hi>of the Father and the Son, as it is</hi> diſcovered in the Goſpel, <hi>Wherein are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.2, 3. <hi>Which to know is life eternal, and the ignorance of it, is death eternal,</hi> Joh. 17.3. 2 Cor. 4.3. You muſt know <hi>that Chriſt is the end of the law,</hi> Rom. 10.4. and therefore you muſt endeavour to know the Commands of the Law, not that you may be enabled by that Knowledge to practife them immediately, and ſo to procure Salvation by your Works; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by your Knowledge of them, you may be made ſenſible of your Inablility to perform them, and of the Enmity that is in your Heart againſt them, and the Wrath that you are under for breaking of them, and the Impoſſibility of being ſaved by your own Works, that ſo you may flee to Chriſt for Refuge, and truſt only to the Free Grace of God for Juſtification and Strength, to fulfill the Law acceptably through Chriſt in your Converſation. And for this end you muſt endeavour to learn the utmoſt Strictneſs of the Commands, the exact Perfection and ſpiritual Purity which they require, that you may be the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96243:147"/>more convinced of Sin, and ſtired up to ſeek un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt for Remiſſion of Sin, for Purity of Heart, and ſpiritual Obedience, and be brought nearer to the Enjoyment of him. As Chriſt teſtified that the <hi>Scribel,</hi> who underſtood the greatneſs of that Command of <hi>Loving the Lord with all the Heart and Soul,</hi> was not far from the <hi>Kingdom of God,</hi> Mar. 12.34. the moſt effectual Knowledge for your Salvation, is to underſtand theſe Two Points. The deſperate Sinfulneſs and Miſery of your own natural Condition, and the alone Sufficiency of the Grace of God in Chriſt for your Salvation, that you may be abaſed as <hi>to the Fleſh,</hi> and exalted <hi>in Chriſt</hi> alone. And for the better underſtanding of theſe Two main Points, you ſhould learn how the <hi>firſt Adam was the figure of the ſecond,</hi> Rom. 5.14. How Sin and Death came upon all the natural Seed of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> by his Diſobedience in <hi>eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit,</hi> and how Righteouſneſs and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life come upon all the ſpiritual Seed of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, by his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto Death, <hi>even the death of the Croſs.</hi> You alſo ſhould learn the true difference betwixt the Two Covenants, the Old and the New, or the Law and the Goſpel; that the former ſhutteth us up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Guilt and Power of Sin, and the Wrath of God and his Curſe, by its rigorons Terms, <hi>Do all the Commandments and live, and curſed are you if you do them not, and fail in the leaſt Point.</hi> The latter <hi>openeth the gates of righteouſneſs, and life to all Believers,</hi> (i. e. the New Covenant) by its gracious Terms, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jeſus Christ and live,</hi> i. e. <hi>All your Sins ſhall be forgiven, and Holineſs and Glory ſhall be given to you freely by his
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:96243:147"/>Merit and Spirit.</hi> Furthermore, you ſhould learn the Goſpel Principles that you are to walk by, for the attainment of Holineſs in Chriſt. And here I ſhall mind you particularly that you would be a good Proficient in Chriſtian Learning, if you get a good Underſtanding of the 6th. and 7th. Chapters of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where the powerful Principles of Sanctification are purpoſely treated of, and differenced from thoſe weak and ineffectual Principles, which we are moſt naturally prone to walk by: I need not particularly commend any other Points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to your Learning; for if you get the Knowledge of theſe principal Points which I have mentioned, and improve it to a right end, which is to Live and Walk by Faith in Chriſt, your own renewed Mind will covet the Knowledge of all other things that appertain to Life and Godlineſs; <hi>And if in any thing you be otherwiſe minded</hi> than is according to ſaving Truth, <hi>God ſhall reveal even this unto you,</hi> Phil. 3.15. Yet let me caution you, leſt inſtead of gaining Chriſt by your Knowledge, you rather loſe him by putting your Knowledge in the place of Chriſt, and truſting on it for your Salvation. One cauſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> periſhing was, <hi>that they rested in a form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law,</hi> Rom. 2.20. and doubtleſs, all that many Chriſtians will gain by their Knowledge in the end, will only be to be beaten with more Stripes, becauſe they place their Religion and Salvation, chiefly in the Knowledge of their Lords Will, and in their Ability to Talk and Diſpute of it, though it may be for the moſt part, at the Tavern or Ale-Bench, <hi>without preparing themſelves to do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96243:148" rendition="simple:additions"/>thereunto,</hi> Luk. 12.47. much leſs are you to place your Religion and hope of Salvation, in a daily Task of reading Chapters, or repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sermons, without underſtanding more than the <hi>Papists</hi> do their Leſſons in the Latin Maſs, and Canonical Hours; as ſad Experience ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that many ſeemingly Devout and frequent Hearers of the Word, do notwithſtanding remain in lamentable and wonderful Ignorance of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Truth; and in them is fulfilled the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaias, That in hearing they ſhall hear and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and in ſeeing they ſhall ſee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.14, 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another means to be uſed diligently for the promoting of the Life of Faith, is Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our State and Ways according to the Word, whether we be at preſent in a State of Sin and Wrath, or of Grace and Salvation; that if we be in a State of Sin, we may know our Sickneſs, and come to the great Phyſician, <hi>while it is called to day:</hi> And if we be in a State of Grace, <hi>ws may know that we are of the truth, and aſſure our hearts before God, with the greater confidence, by the teſtimony of a good conſcience,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.19, 21. that ſo our Hearts may be more ſtrongly comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Faith, and eſtabliſhed in every good work; and that if our ways be evil, <hi>we may turn from them to the Lord our God through Chriſt, without whom none cometh to the Father,</hi> Lam. 3.40. Joh. 14.6. But your great care in this work of Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, muſt be to perform it in ſuch a manner, that it may not hinder and deſtroy the Life of Faith, as it doth in many, inſtead of promoting it. Therefore beware leſt you truſt upon your Self-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, rather than upon Chriſt: As ſome do that think they have made their Peace with God, meerly
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96243:148"/>becauſe they have examined themſelves upon their Sick-Bed, or before the Receiving of the Lords Supper, though they have found themſelves Stark Naught, and do not depend on Chriſt to make them better; but on their own deceitful Purpoſes and Reſolutions. Think not that you muſt begin this Work with doubting whether God will extend Mercy to you, and ſave you, and that you muſt leave this, a Queſtion wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate until you have found out how to reſolve it by Self-examination. This is a common and very pernicious Error in the very foundation of this Work, which is hereby laid in the great Sin of Unbelief, which as ſoon as it prevaileth, doth by its great Influence, Daſh and Obſcure all inward gracious Qualifications of Peace, Hope, Joy, Love to God and his People, before they be at all tryed whether they can give any good Evidence for their Salvation. And it makes People willing to think their own Qualifications better than they are, leſt they ſhould fall into an utter Deſpair of their Salvation; and thus it wholly marreth the good work of Self-examination, and maketh it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to our Souls; <hi>For to them that are defiled and unbelieving, there is nothing pure,</hi> Tit. 1.15. You ſhould rather begin the work with much aſſurance of Faith, that though you find your Heart never ſo wicked and reprobate at preſent, (as many of God's choiceſt Servants do often find) yet the Door of Mercy is open for you, and that God <hi>will certainly</hi> ſave you for ever, <hi>if you put your truſt in</hi> his Grace <hi>through Chriſt.</hi> I have formerly ſhewed that this confident Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is of the nature of ſaving Faith, and that we have ſufficient Ground for it in the Free Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:96243:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the Goſpel; when we walk in Darkneſs and can ſee no Light ſhining forth in our graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Qualifications. If we begin the work with this Confidence, it will make us impartial and not afraid to find out the worſt by our ſelves, and willing to judge that <hi>our hearts are deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked beyond what we can find out,</hi> Jer. 17.9. And if we <hi>have any holy Qualifications,</hi> this Confidence will preſerve them in their Vigour and Brightneſs, that they may be able to give clear Evidence, that we are at preſent in a State of Grace. Mark well the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt theſe Two Queſtions, whether God will graciouſly accept and ſave me, though a vile Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner through Chriſt, as before was ſaid, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am already brought into a State of <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> The former of theſe I ſay, is to be reſolved affirmatively by a confident Faith in Chriſt; the latter only is to be inquired into by Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Miſ-ſpend not your time as many do, in poring upon your Hearts, to find whether you be good enough to truſt on Chriſt for your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor to find whether you have any Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you dare be ſo bold as to act Faith in Chriſt. But know that though you cannot find that you have any Faith or Holineſs, yet if you will <hi>now believe-on him that juſtifyeth the ungodly, it ſhall be accounted to you for righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4.5. And if you love Chriſt and your own Soul, miſ-ſpend not your time in examining whether you have committed the unpardonable Sin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, except it be with a full Purpoſe to aſſure your ſelf more and more, that you are not guilty thereof; for any Doubtfulneſs in this Point, will but harden you in Unbelief. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:96243:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>well that the Queſtion to be reſolved, is, Whether you be at preſent in a ſtate of Grace? and to reſolve it, you muſt be willing to know the beſt by your ſelf as well as the worſt: And you muſt not think that Humility bindeth you to overlook your good Qualifications, and to take notice only of your Corruptions. But your great work muſt be, to find whether there be not ſome Drop of ſaving Grace in the Ocean of your Corruption? And it will conſiſt well with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to take notice of, and own any Spark of true Holineſs that is in you, becauſe the Praiſe and Glory of it belongeth not to you, <hi>but to God,</hi> Phil. 1.11. And you muſt try inherent Grace by the Touch-ſtone, not by the Meaſure; by its Nature, <hi>not its Degree;</hi> not denying any Luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit in you, becauſe of the ſtrong Luſtings of the Fleſh againſt the Spirit; nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that you are Spiritual in ſome degree, and Babes in Chriſt; becauſe you find your ſelves car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in a more prevailing degree, <hi>and the old man bigger than the new,</hi> Gal. 5.17. 1 Cor. 3.1. Eſpecially you are to examine and prove whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be in the Faith; for if you make ſure of this, you make ſure of all the things that pertain to Life and Godlineſs; and if you doubt of this, you will certainly doubt of the Truth of any other Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and will ſuſpect them to be meerly Carnal and Counterfeit; becauſe it is a known Truth, <hi>that to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving there is nothing pure,</hi> and that all that have not truly received Chriſt by Faith, are at preſent in an unregenerate State, though they ſeem never ſo Pure and Godly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. And let not the Iſſue of this Tryal depend at all upon your Knowledge of the time
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96243:150"/>when, or of the Sermon, Conference, or Place of Scripture, by which you were firſt converted to the Faith; though that is good to know too, if it may be. And ſome who have formerly lived in groſs Ignorance, or in a manifeſt Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to true Faith and Holineſs, may know ſuch Circumſtances of their Converſion, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon them comfortably, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did, who was turned of a ſuddain from his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Rage, to be a Diſciple and an Apoſtle of Chriſt; yet others, ſincere Believers, may be wholly Ignorant of them, as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>who was filled with the Holy Ghost from his mothers Womb,</hi> Luk. 1.15. and they that have been train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up religiouſly, <hi>and known the Holy Scripture from their Childhood, as</hi> Timothy, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. Yea, and many that are firſt turned from groſs Ignorance and Profaneneſs, to ſome external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and then in proceſs of time, brought nearer to the Kingdom of Heaven, by inſenſible Degrees, before they be really new begotten by the Spirit of Faith. There are alſo ſome that deceive their Souls, by imagining that they know at what time, and by what Text of Scripture they were converted; and can make large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the workings of God upon their Hearts, and are prone to talk unſeaſonably with Vain-glorying of their own Experiences, when at laſt, all their Experiences are not ſufficient to evidence that they ever attained to the leaſt meaſure of true ſaving Faith. Therefore that we may not unjuſtly condemn or juſtify our Faith, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding on in-ſufficient Evidences in its Tryal, <hi>our beſt way, is to examine it by the inſeparable Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a true ſaving Faith, by putting to our ſelves
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:96243:150"/>ſuch Queſtions as theſe;</hi> Are we made throughly ſenſible of our Sinfulneſs, and of the Deadneſs and Miſery of our natural State, ſo as to deſpair abſolutely of ever attaining to any Righteouſneſs, Holyneſs or true Happineſs while we continue in it? Are the Eyes of our Underſtandings enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee the Excellency of Chriſt, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Sufficiency and All-ſufficiency of his Grace for our Salvation? Do we prefer the Enjoyment of him above all things, and deſire it with our whole Heart, as our only Happineſs, whatſoever we may ſuffer for his ſake? Do we deſire with our whole Heart to be delivered from the Power and Practice of Sin, as well as from the Wrath of God and the Pains of Hell? Do our Hearts come to Chriſt and lay hold on him for Salvation, by truſting him only, and endeavouring to truſt on him confidently notwithſtanding all Fears and Doubts that aſſault us? If you find in your ſelf a Faith that hath theſe Properties, though as ſmall as a Grain of Muſtard-Seed, and oppoſed with much Unbelief and manifold Corruptions in your Soul, you may conclude that you are in a ſtate of Salvation at preſent, and that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining work is to continue and grow in it more and more, and to walk worthy of it; you ſhould alſo examine the Fruits of your Faith, and try whether you can <hi>ſhew your Faith by your works,</hi> as you are taught, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.18. that you may be ſure not to be deceived in your Judgment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. And though it be true as I have noted, that Doubts concerning your Faith will breed doubting concerning the Sincerity of other Qualifications that are Fruits thereof, yet poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you may get ſuch clear Evidences of your
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:96243:151"/>Sincerity, as may overcome and expell all your Doubts. And here you are not only to enquire whether your Inclinations, Purpoſes, Affections and Actions be materially good and holy, but alſo by what Principles they are bred and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced? Whether it be by ſlaviſh fears of Hell, and mercenary hopes of getting Heaven by your Works, which are legal and carnal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that can never breed true Holineſs; or by Goſpel Principles as by love to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath loved you firſt, and to Chriſt, becauſe he hath dyed; and by the hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, as the free Gift of God through Chriſt, and dependance on God to ſanctify you by his Spirit according to his Promiſes. Remember that the New Teſtament <hi>is the miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. and the Spirit will ſanctify us, not by legal, but by Goſpel Principles. Take notice further, that you need not trouble your ſelf to find out a multitude of Marks and Signs of true Grace, if you can find a few good ones: Particularly you may know, <hi>That you are paſſed from death to life, if you love the brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.14. <hi>i. e.</hi> if you love all whom you can in Charity, judge to be true Believers, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are true Believers, and for the Truth Sake that dwelleth in them. <hi>As</hi> Solomon <hi>diſcerned the true Mother of the Child, by her Affection towards her Child; ſo the Mother Grace of Faith, may be diſcerned by the Love that it breeds in us, toward all true Believers.</hi> To conclude this Point, Happy are you if you can find ſo much Evidence of the Fruits of your Faith, as may enable you to expreſs your Sincerity in theſe moderate Terms, <hi>Pray for us, for we truſt we have a good
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:96243:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>conſcience in all things, willing to live honeſtly,</hi> Heb. 13.18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Meditation on the Word of God is of very great uſe and advantage, for the attainment and practice of Holineſs through Faith in Chriſt. It is a Duty whereby the Soul doth Feed and Rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate upon the Word as its Spiritual Food, and digeſteth it, and turneth it into Nouriſhment, whereby we are ſtrengthned for every good Work. Our Souls are ſatisfied therewith, as with <hi>marrow and fatneſs:</hi> When we remember God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Beds, and <hi>meditate on him in the Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watches,</hi> Pſal. 68.5, 6. The <hi>new Nature</hi> may well be called the <hi>Mind,</hi> Rom. 7.25. becauſe it liveth and acteth, by minding of, and meditating on <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things.</hi> Therefore it is a Duty to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, not only at ſome limited times, but <hi>all the day,</hi> Pſal. 119.97. yea, <hi>day and night,</hi> Pſal. 1.2. even in our ordinary Employments at home and abroad. An habitual knowledge of the Word will not profit us, without an active minding it by frequent Meditation. Some think, that much Preaching of the Word is not needful, where a People are already brought to the knowledge of thoſe things that are <hi>neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> But they that are regenerated by the Word, find by Experience; that their Spiritual Life is maintained and encreaſed by often minding the ſame Word: And therefore as <hi>new born Babes, they deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that they may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. and would by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, be put often in remembrance of the ſame things, that they may feed upon them by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, tho they know them already, and are eſtabliſhed in the preſent Truth, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:96243:152"/>But here our greateſt Skill, and chiefeſt Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies, in practiſing this Duty in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that it may be ſubſervient, and not at all oppoſite to the Life of Faith. We muſt not rely upon the performance of a daily task of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as a work of Righteouſneſs for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement of the Favour of God, inſtead of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as indeed we are prone to do, to catch at any Straw rather than to truſt only on the Free Grace of God in Chriſt for our Salvation. And the end of our Meditation muſt not be meer Speculation and Knowledge of the Truth, but rather the vigorous preſſing it upon our Conſciences, and the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up our Hearts and Affections to the Practice of it: And in ſtirring up our ſelves to holy Practice, we muſt warily obſerve how far the ſeveral parts of the Truth of God are powerful and effectual for the attainment of this End, that we may make uſe of them accordingly. We muſt not imagine as too many do, yea, and ſome great Maſters in the Art of Meditation, that we can bring our Hearts effectually to the Love of God and Holineſs, and can work ſtrange Metamorphoſes, and work or frame in our Hearts any holy Qualifications or Vertue, meerly by working in our ſelves ſtrong Apprehenſions of God's eternal Power and God-head, his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority, Omniſcience, perfect Holineſs, exact Juſtice, the equity of his Law, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of our Obedience to it; the unſpeakable Happineſs prepared for the Godly, and Miſery for the Wicked to all Eternity. Meditation on ſuch things as theſe, is indeed very uſeful to preſs upon our Conſciences the Strictneſs of our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:96243:152"/>to holy Duties, and to move us to go by Faith to Chriſt, for Life and Strength to perform them. But that we may receive this Life and Strength whereby we are enabled for immediate performance, we muſt meditate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievingly on Chriſt's ſaving Benefits, as they are diſcovered in the Goſpel, which is the only Doctrin which is the Power of God to our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and whereby the quickning Spirit <hi>is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred to us, and that is able to build us up, and give us an inheritance among all them which are ſanctifyed,</hi> Rom. 1.16. 2 Cor. 3.6. Act. 20.32. You muſt take ſpecial care to act Faith in your Meditation, mix the Word of God's Grace with it, or elſe it will <hi>not profit you,</hi> Heb. 4.2. and if you ſet the <hi>loving kindneſs of God</hi> frequently <hi>before your eyes,</hi> by meditating on it believingly, you will be ſtrengthned to <hi>walk in the truth,</hi> Pſal. 26.2. and by <hi>beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, you will be changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. This kind of Meditation is ſweet and delightful to thoſe that are guided to it by the Spirit of Faith, and it needs not the help of ſuch artificial-Methods as the Vulgar cannot eaſily learn: You may let your Thoughts run in it at liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confining them to any rules of Method; you will find your Souls much enlivened by it, and enriched with the Grace of God, which cannot be effected by any other kind of Meditation, though it be never ſo methodical, and curiouſly framed according to the Rules of Art.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Sacrament of Baptiſm muſt needs be of great uſe to promote the Life of Faith, if it be made uſe of according to its Nature and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:96243:153"/>
                  <hi>becauſe it is a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of faith, as circumciſion</hi> was formerly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. But then we muſt take heed of making it a Seal of the contrary Righteouſneſs of Works, as the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> did, that ſought to be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as many Chriſtians do, that <hi>transform the New Covenant into a Covenant of Works, requiring ſincere Obedience to all the Laws of Christ, as the condition of our Juſtification;</hi> into which new deviſed Covenant, they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>entred by their Baptiſm.</hi> I may ſay of Baptiſm thus perverted and abuſed, as the <hi>Apoſtle ſaith of Circumciſion.</hi> Baptiſm verily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth if thou keep the Law, but if thou be a Breaker of the Law, thy Baptiſm is made no Baptiſm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. If thou be Baptiſed, ſo long as thou continueſt in the abuſe of that holy Ordinance, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing; Chriſt is become of no effect to you; <hi>Ye are all fallen from grace,</hi> Gal. 3.2.4. Beware alſo of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an Idol of Baptiſm, and putting it in the place of Chriſt, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, who hold that it conferreth Grace by the very work that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Adminiſtration of it. And as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ignorant People do, that truſt rather on their Baptiſm, than on Chriſt; like to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who placed their Confidence on Circumciſion, and other external Privileges, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.4, 5. We are to know that God is not well pleaſed with many that are Baptiſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2, 5. and the time will come when he will puniſh the Baptiſed with the Unbaptiſed, as well as the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed with the uncircumciſed,</hi> Jer. 9.25. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware alſo of advancing Baptiſm to an equal Partnerſhip with Faith in your Salvation, as ſome
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:96243:153"/>do, who account all Baptiſm null and void, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which is adminiſtred to perſons grown up to years of Diſcretion, and they that refuſe to be re-baptized at thoſe years, are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Aliens from the true Church, from Chriſt and his Salvation, notwithſtanding all their Faith in Chriſt. If the Baptiſm of Infants were null and void, yet the want of true Baptiſm would be no Damning matter to thoſe that are otherwiſe perſwaded. Circumciſion was as neceſſary as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in its time, and yet the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> omitted it for the ſpace of forty years in the Wilderneſs, without fearing that any would <hi>fall ſhort of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for want of it,</hi> John 5.6, 7. Many precious Saints in the Primitive times of Perſecution, have gone to Heaven through a Baptiſm of Suffering for the Name of Chriſt, before they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be Baptized with Water: And in thoſe ancient Times, when the Cuſtom of deferring Baptiſm too much prevailed, we are not to think, that none were in a ſtate of Salvation by Faith in Chriſt, that deferred that Ordinance, or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. Take notice further, that it is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to avoid the pernicious Errors of thoſe that pervert Baptiſm, contrary to its Inſtitution; but you muſt be alſo diligent in the improving of it to the ends for which it was inſtituted. And here let me deſire you to put the Queſtion ſeriouſly to your Souls, What good uſe you do make of your Baptiſm? How often, or ſeldom do you think upon it? The vulgar ſort of Chriſtians, yea it may be feared, many ſincere Converts, do ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle think upon their own Baptiſm, and ſtudy to make a due improvement of it, that its of no more profit to their Souls, than if they never had
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96243:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>bin Baptized; yea, their ſin is the more aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by rendring ſuch an Ordinance of none effect to their Souls, through their own groſs neglect. Tho Baptiſm be adminiſtred to us but once in our Lives, yet we ought frequently to reflect upon it, and upon all Occaſions to put the Queſtion to our ſelves, Into what were we Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2. What this Ordinance Seals? What did it engage us to? And accordingly, we muſt ſtir up and ſtrengthen our ſelves by our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to lay hold on the Grace which it ſeals to us, and to fulfil its Engagements. We ſhould often remember, that we are made Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by Baptiſm, and engaged to hear him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Moſes,</hi> and to Believe on him for our Salvation; as <hi>John</hi> baptized with the Baptiſm of Repentance, ſaying to the People, <hi>That they ſhould believe on him that ſhould come after him,</hi> i. e. <hi>on Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> We ſhould remember, that our Baptiſm ſealed our putting on of Chriſt, and our being the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt, and our being no longer under the former School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.25, 26, 27. And that it ſealed to us the <hi>putting off the body of ſin,</hi> and our <hi>Burial and Reſurrection with Chriſt by Faith,</hi> and the <hi>forgiving of our treſpaſſes,</hi> Col. 2.12, 13. Our being made <hi>Members of one Body of Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>drink into one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. We may find by ſuch things as theſe which are more fully diſcovered in the Goſpel, that it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature and tendency of Baptiſm, to guide us to Faith in Chriſt alone for remiſſion of Sins, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and all Salvation, by Union and Fellowſhip with him, and that a diligent improvement of this
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:96243:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>Ordinance, muſt needs be of great advantage to the Life of Faith.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Sacrament of the Lords Supper is as a ſpiritual Feaſt to nouriſh our Faith, and to ſtrengthen us to walk in all Holineſs by Chriſt living and working in us; if it be uſed according to the Patern which Chriſt gave us in its firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, recorded by Three Evangeliſts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.22, 24. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.19, 20. and was extrordinarily revealed from Heaven by Chriſt himſelf to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23, 25. that we might be the more obliged and ſtirred up to the exact Obſervation of it. Its end is not only that we may remember Chriſts Death in the Hiſtory, but in the Myſtery of it; as that his Body was broken for us, that his Blood is the Blood of the New Teſtament or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>ſhed for us and for</hi> many for the remiſſion of Sins, that ſo we may receive and enjoy all the Promiſes of the New Covenant which are record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. Its end is to mind us that Chriſts Body and Blood are Bread and Drink, even all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Food to nouriſh our Souls to everlaſting Life, and that we ought to take, and eat, and drink him by Faith, and to aſſure us that when we <hi>truly believe on him, he is as really and cloſely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to us by his Spirit, as the Food which we eat and drink is united to our Bodies.</hi> Chriſt himſelf <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. doth more fully explain this Myſtery. Furthermore, this Sacrament doth not only put us in mind of the ſpiritual Bleſſings, wherewith we are Bleſſed in Chriſt and our Enjoyment of them by Faith, but alſo it is a Mean and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby God doth really exhibit and give forth Chriſt and his Salvation to true Believers,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96243:155" rendition="simple:additions"/>and whereby he doth ſtir up, and ſtrengthen Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to receive and feed upon Chriſt by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent actings of Faith, while they partake of the outward Elements. When Chriſt ſaith <hi>eat, drink, this is my body, this is my blood,</hi> no leſs can be meant, than that Chriſt doth as truly give his Body and Blood to true Believers in that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as the Bread and Cup; and they do as truly receive it by Faith. As if a Prince inveſt a Subject in ſome Honourable Office, by delivering to him a Staff, Sword or Signet, and ſay to him, take this Staff, Sword or Signet, this is ſuch an Office or Preferment; <hi>or if a Father ſhould deliver a Deed for Conveyance of Land to his Son, and ſay, take it as thine own, this is ſuch a Farm or Mannor,</hi> how can ſuch Expreſſions import any leſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senfe and Reaſon, than a Preſent, Gift and Conveyance of the Offices, Preferments and Lands, by, and with thoſe outward Signs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerteth, <hi>that the bread in the Lords ſupper, is the communion of the body of Chriſt, and the cup is the communion of his blood,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.16. which ſheweth that Chriſt's Body and Blood, <hi>are really</hi> communicated to us, and we <hi>do really partake of them,</hi> as well as of the Bread and Cup. The chief Excellency and Advantage of this Ordinance is, That it is not <hi>only a Figure</hi> and <hi>Reſemblance</hi> of our living upon a crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but alſo a precious Inſtrument, whereby Chriſt the Bread and Drink of Life, <hi>is really conveyed to us, and received by us through Faith.</hi> This makes it to be a Love-Token, worthy of that ardent Affection toward us, which filled Chriſt's Heart at the time when he inſtituted it, when he was on the point of finiſhing of his
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:96243:155"/>greateſt work of Love, by <hi>laying down his Life for us,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23. And this is diligently to be obſerved, that we may make a right improvement of this Ordinance, and receive the ſaving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits of it. One reaſon why many do little eſteem, and ſeldom or never partake of this Ordinance, and do find little benefit by it is, becauſe they falſly imagine, that God in it only holds forth naked ſigns and reſemblances of Chriſt and his Salvation, which they account to be held forth ſo plainly in Scripture, that they need not the help of ſuch a ſign: Whereas, if they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that God <hi>doth really give Chriſt himſelf to their Faith,</hi> by and with thoſe Signs and Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, they would prize it as the moſt delicious Feaſt, and be deſirous to partake of it on all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. and 20.7. Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why many partake ſeldom or never of this Ordinance, and know little of the benefit of it, is, becauſe they think themſelves brought by it into great danger of <hi>eating and drinking their own Damnation,</hi> according to thoſe terrifying words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. therefore they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it the ſafeſt way wholly to abſtain from ſuch a dangerous Ordinance; or at leaſt, that once a year is enough to run ſo great a Hazard. And if they be brought to it ſometimes by conſtraint of Conſcience, their ſlaviſh Fears bereave them of all comfortable Fruit of it. So that inſtead of ſtriving to receive Chriſt and his Salvation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they account themſelves to have ſucceeded well, if they come off without the Sentence of Damnation. As the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbies</hi> write, that the High-Prieſts Life was ſo eminently hazarded by his entring once a year into the Holy of Holies,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:96243:156"/>that he ſtayed there as little time as he could, leſt the People ſhould think him to be ſtruck dead by the Hand of God: And when he was come forth alive, he uſually made a Feaſt of Thankſgiving for Joy of ſo great a Deliverance. But there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould be ſo much terrified by thoſe words of the Apoſtle, for they were darted againſt ſuch a groſs prophanation of the Lords Supper amongſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> as we may eaſily avoid, by obſerving the Inſtitution of it, which the Apoſtle propoſeth to them as a ſufficient remedy againſt the groſs abuſe, in not diſcerning or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing the <hi>Lords Body from other bodily Food,</hi> and partaking of it as their own Supper, with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, that one was Hungry, and another Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Beſides, that terrifying word Damnation, may be rendred more mildly <hi>Judgment,</hi> as it is in the Margent; yea the Apoſtle himſelf, <hi>Ver.</hi> 32. doth interpret it of a merciful, <hi>temporal Judgment,</hi> whereby we are <hi>chaſtened</hi> of the Lord, that we ſhould not be <hi>condemned</hi> with the World. We are indeed prone to ſin in receiving this Ordinance unworthily, and ſo we are alſo to pollute more or leſs, all other holy things that we meddle with. So that the conſideration of our danger might ſill us with ſlaviſh fear in the uſe of all other means of Grace as well as of this, were it not that we have a great High-Prieſt, to bear this Iniquity of our <hi>holy things,</hi> Exod. 28.38. under the Covert of whoſe Righteouſneſs we are to draw near unto God, without ſlaviſh fear in the full aſſurance of Faith, in this as well as in other holy Ordinances; and we are to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord</hi> in this ſpiritual Feaſt, as the <hi>Jews were bound</hi> to do in their <hi>ſolemn Feasts,</hi> Deut. 16.14, 15. There are other Abuſes
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:96243:156"/>of this Ordinance like to thoſe of Baptiſm forementioned, whereby it is rendred op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, rather than ſubſervient to the Life of Faith. Some put it in the place of Chriſt by truſting on it as a work of Righteouſneſs, for the procuring of Gods Favour, or an Ordinance ſufficient to confer Grace to the Soul by the very work wrought. Others make it ſo neceſſary, that they account that Faith is not ſufficient without it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will partake of it if they can poſſibly, tho it be in a <hi>diſorderly manner upon their ſick-Beds,</hi> when they are in fear of Death, as their <hi>Viaticum.</hi> The Papiſts do horribly Idolize it by their figment of Tranſubſtantiation, and the Adoration of their Breaden God, and their Sacrifice of the Maſs for the ſins of the Quick and the Dead. We ought warily to conceive, that the true Body and Blood of Chriſt are given to us, with the Bread and Wine, in a <hi>ſpiritual myſterious manner,</hi> by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Operation of the Holy Spirit, <hi>uniting Chriſt and us together by Faith,</hi> without any Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation in the outward Elements.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Prayer is to be made uſe of, as a means of living by Faith in Chriſt, according to the New Man. And it is the making our Requeſts with Supplication and Thankfgiving: That it is to be uſed ſo, as an eminent Means appears, becauſe God requireth it, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. It is our prieſtly Work, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. and the property of Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. and God is a God, hearing Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. God will be prayed to by his People for the benefit that he is minded to beſtow upon them when once he hath enabled them to pray; though at firſt he is found of them that ſeek him not,

                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, 37. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.19, 20. that he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for Thankſgiving, and make Benefits double Benefits to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16, 18, 19. and 50.15. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. 11. Though his Will be not changed by this means; yet it is accompliſhed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, and his Purpoſe is to accompliſh it this way. And therefore truſting aſſuredly ſhould not make us neglect, but rather perform this Duty, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27. Chriſt the Mediator of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by which Juſtification and Sanctification are promiſed, is alſo the Mediator for Acceptance of our Prayers, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16.

God heareth the Heart without the Mouth, but never heareth the Mouth acceptably without the Heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. Your Prayer is odious Hypocriſie, mocking of God, and taking his Name in vain, when you utter Petitions for the <hi>coming of his Kingdom,</hi> and <hi>doing of his Will,</hi> and yet hate Godlineſs in your Heart. This is Lying to God, and ſlattering with your Lips, but no true Prayer; and ſo God takes it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:96243:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>and you muſt have a ſenſe of your wants and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and that God only can ſupply, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. And <hi>fervency</hi> in thoſe deſires is required, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. And you muſt pray with <hi>attention,</hi> minding your ſelves what you pray, or elſe you cannot expect that God ſhould mind it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Watch</hi> to it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. Set your ſelves to this Duty intently. God ſeeth where your Heart is wandring, when you <hi>pray without attention, Ezek.</hi> 33.31. When you ſay never ſo many prayers without Underſtanding, Attention, Affection, it is not praying at all, but ſinning and playing the Hypocrite, as Papiſts mumble over their Latin Prayers upon the Beads by Tale, prating like Parrots, what they cannot underſtand. And thus ignorant People ſay over their Forms of Engliſh Prayers, and account they have well-diſcharged their Duty, tho their Heart prayed not at all, and were minding other things. This is a meer Lip-labour and bodily Exerciſe, offering a <hi>dead Carcaſs</hi> to God, <hi>plain deceit,</hi> Mal. 1.13, 14. a <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> with <hi>denying the Power,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5. whereby Popery hath cheated the World of the Power of this, and all other Holy Ordinances. They ſay, God minds and knows what they ſpeak, and approves it. I anſwer, He doth ſo as to Judg them for Hypocrites and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for not knowing, minding and approving what they utter themſelves: He <hi>hath no pleaſure in Fools, Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1, 2. They would not deal ſo with an Earthly Prince.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt pray in the Name of Chriſt; <hi>for the Spirit glorifies Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 16. <hi>and leadeth us to God through Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2.18. As I have ſhewed that walking in the Spirit and walking in Chriſt,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96243:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>is all one, ſo praying in the Spirit, and by, and through Chriſt: And as we are to walk in the Name of the Lord, and to do all things in his Name, as is commanded, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13, 14. It is not enough to conclude our Prayers, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> but we muſt come for Bleſſings in the Garments of our elder Brother, and muſt depend upon his Worthyneſs and Strength for all. So alſo we muſt praiſe God <hi>for all things in his Name,</hi> as things received for his ſake, and by him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.20. We muſt lay hold on his Strength only, and plead nothing, and own nothing for our Acceptance but him. We muſt not plead our own works arrogantly, like the proud <hi>Phariſee, Luk.</hi> 18.11.12. except only as Fruits of Grace, and Rewards of Grace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.1, 2. Praying in the Spirit is upon Goſpel, not legal Principles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6. with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. with great Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſenſe of Unworthyneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. with a broken Spirit, with Deſpair of Acceptance, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than upon Chriſt's Account, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18. If your Enlargements, Struglings, Meltings, have been never ſo great, yet without this, all is Abominable.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence you muſt not think to be accepted for the Goodneſs of your Prayers, and truſt on them as works of Righteouſneſs, which is making Idols of your Prayers, and putting them into the place of Chriſt, quite contrary to praying in the Name of Chriſt. Thus <hi>Papiſts</hi> hope to be ſav'd by ſaying their Tale of Prayers upon their Bead-Rows; and they have Indulgences granted upon their ſaying ſo many Prayers, and of ſuch a ſort. Yea, ſome ignorant Proteſtants, truſt on their Prayer as Duties of Righteouſneſs; and they
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96243:159"/>think one Prayer to be more acceptable than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by reaſon of the Holineſs of the Form, if it were made by Holy Men; eſpecially the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which they uſe to help them in any Exigence or Danger; how little ſoever they can apply it to their own Caſe, they make an Idol of it. And ſome uſe it and other places of Scriptures, as a Spell or Charm, to drive away the Devil: And others think their Prayers more acceptable in one place than in another, by reaſon of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.21, 24.1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. Others truſt on their <hi>much ſpeaking,</hi> Mat. 6. which they call the enlarging of their Hearts. They think to put off God, and ſtop the Mouth of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with a few Prayers, and ſo to live as they liſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Pray to God as your Father, through Chriſt as your Saviour, in Faith of Remiſſion of Sins, and your acceptance with God, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing of all other things which you deſire of him, as far as is neceſſary for your Salvation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7. <hi>ch.</hi> 5.15. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. and 86.7. and 55.16. and 57.1, 2. and 17.6. This is praying in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. and by the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of Adoption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. Without this, Prayer is Lifeleſs and Heartleſs, and but a dead Carcaſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.4. By this you may judge whether you have prayed rightly, more than by your melting Affection, or large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Expreſſion. Though you be not aſſured that you ſhall have every thing that you ask, yet every thing that is good. This Faith you muſt endeavour to act; and therefore if any Sin lye on
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96243:160"/>Conſcience, you muſt ſtrive firſt to get the Pardon of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1.5. and 51.14, 15. and Puriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from it by Faith, that you may <hi>lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.8. The <hi>ſin of wrath</hi> there is eſpecially mentioned, becauſe that is <hi>contrary to Love and forgiving others.</hi> Here lyes the Strength, Life and Powerfulneſs of Prayer: Set Faith on work, and you will be powerful and prevail.</p>
               <p n="5">5. You muſt ſtrive in Prayer to ſtir up, and act every other ſanctifying Grace through Faith, moving you thereunto. Thus your Spikenards will yield their Smell, <hi>as godly ſorrow,</hi> Pſal. 38.18. <hi>peace,</hi> Iſa. 27.8. <hi>joy,</hi> Pſal. 105.3. <hi>hope,</hi> Pſal. 71.5. <hi>deſire and love to God,</hi> Pſal. 4.6. <hi>and love to all his commands,</hi> Pſal. 119.4, 5. <hi>and to his people out of love to him,</hi> Pſal. 122. <hi>you muſt ſeek the Spirit it ſelf in the firſt place,</hi> Luk. 11.13. Pſal. 37.5. <hi>and all ſpiritual things,</hi> Mat. 6.33. Praying only for carnal things, ſhews a carnal Heart, and leaves it carnal, <hi>Pray for faith,</hi> Mar. 9.24. and for ſuch things as may ſerve moſt for the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.11, 12. and for outward things, you muſt act in ſubmiſſion to his Will; and thus Prayer ſets you in a holy frame, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.42. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.42, 43. Hallowing Gods Name, muſt be your aim, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. not your Luſts, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.3.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Strive to bring your Soul into order by this Duty, however diſordered by Guilt, Anguiſh, inordinate Cares or Fears, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 5. and 55.16, 17, 20, 22. and 69.32. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6, 7.1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. A Watch muſt be often wound up; you muſt wreſtle in Prayer againſt your Unbelief, Doubting, Fears, Cares, Reluctancy of the Fleſh, to that which is good, againſt all Evil, Luſts and
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96243:160"/>Deſires; Coldneſs of Affection, Impatience, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Spirit, every thing that's contrary to an Holy Life, and the Graces and holy Deſires to be acted for your ſelves or others, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. Stir up your ſelves to the Duty, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. Though the Fleſh be croſs and reluctant, we muſt not yield, but reſiſt by the Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. And thus we ſhall find the Spirit helping our Infirmities, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. Though God ſeem to defer long, we muſt not faint or be diſcouraged, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1, 7. The greater our Agonies be, the more earneſtly we are to pray, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1, 2. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.42. This is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. Thus you will find Prayer a great Heart-work, and not ſuch a thing as may be done while you think on other things, and that it requireth all the Strength of Faith and Affection, that you can poſſibly ſtir up: Thus you may get a holy Frame.</p>
               <p n="7">7. You muſt make a good uſe of the whole matter, and all the manner of Prayer, as ordinary and extraordinary Exigencies may require to ſtir up Grace in you, by wreſtling, and to bring your Hearts into a holy Frame. As in Confeſſion, you muſt condemn your ſelf according to the Fleſh, but not as you are in Chriſt. You muſt not deny that Grace that you have, as if you were only wicked hitherto, and now to begin again, which hinders Praiſe for Grace received in thoſe that are already converted. In Supplication you muſt endeavour to work up your Heart to a godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.18. and a holy ſenſe of your own Sin and Miſery, and lay before you the Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. Complaint and Lamentation are one great part of Prayer,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:96243:161"/>as Lamentations of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> And you muſt add pleading to your Petitions, with ſuch Arguments as may ſerve to ſtrengthen Faith, and to ſtir up, and kindle Affection, <hi>Job</hi> 23.4. which pleadings are taken from Attributes, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.17, 18. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27, 28, &amp;c. <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9, 12. the equity of our cauſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.2, 3. the advantage and benefit of the thing to the glory of God and our comfort, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.9.10, 13. Naked Petitions are not ſufficient, when the Soul findeth ſpecial cauſe of ſtrugling and wreſtling againſt Corruptions and Dangers, and for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Chriſts large Prayer is made up, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. of pleading, and very few Petitions. And we muſt make uſe alſo of Praiſe and Thankſgiving, for to ſtir up Peace, Joy, Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gen. 33.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. and 33.1. and 74.14. and 104.34. Eſpecially be much in praiſing God for Mercies of the new State in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. and then you will the better give thanks for all benefits on his account, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.20. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.18. and plead thoſe Benefits to ſtir up to Faith and Duty. That brief Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, <hi>Lord have mercy on me,</hi> is very good to be uſed; but it will not anſwer the end and uſe of the whole Duty of Prayer, as ſome lazy carnal People would have it, and ſo harden themſelves in the neglect of the Duty. Though the large Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and uſe of all the matter of Prayer at all times, is not required, but only as ordinary, or extraordinary Occaſions may require.</p>
               <p n="8">8. You muſt not confine and limit your Prayers by any preſcribed Form, ſeeing it is impoſſible that any ſuch Forms ſhould be contrived, as ſhould anſwer and fit, all the various Conditions and Neceſſities of the Soul at all times: I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:96243:161"/>all Forms, as that made by Chriſt, the Lords Prayer; though it were eaſie to ſhew that Chriſt never intended it for a Form of Prayer, ſo as to bind any to the preciſe Form of Words; and it's plain the Spirit of God hath expreſſed it in different Words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. But better to pray by that Form or other Forms, than not at all. It is uncharitable to take away Crutches, or Woodden Leggs from lame People, yet none will look upon them <hi>but as dead helps.</hi> I ſay it is <hi>utterly unlawful to bind our ſelves</hi> to any Form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none can anſwer the Duty fitly, and ſuitably to particular occaſions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.20. You muſt make the whole Scripture <hi>your Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> as the Primitive Church did, being the Language of the Spirit reaching all Occaſions and Conditions, and ſitteſt to ſpeak to God in. And if you uſe a Form, you muſt follow it by the Spirit, further than the Form goes, according as he ſhall guide you by the Word, or elſe you <hi>quench the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.19. If you know the Principles of Prayer, and have a lively ſenſe of your Neceſſities, and hearty Deſires of Gods Grace and Mercies, you will be able to pray without Forms, and your Affections will bring forth words out of the fulneſs of your Heart. And you need not be over-ſolicitous and timorous about words; for doubtlesſ, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit who is the help to us in ſpeaking to Men, will alſo much more help us to ſpeak to God, if we deſire it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.12. And God regards not eloquent Words, nor artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Compoſure, neither need we regard it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.14. If you limit your ſelf to Forms, you will thereby grow formal, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Spirit.</p>

               <p n="7">7. Another means appointed of God, is Singing of Pſalms, <hi>i. e.</hi> Songs of any ſacred Subject compoſed to a Tune, are Hymns or Songs of Praiſe, and ſpiritual Songs, of any ſublime ſpiritual Matter, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. and the Song of <hi>Solomon.</hi> God hath commanded it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.19. in the New Teſtament. Though now in theſe days, many queſtion whether it be an Ordinance or no; and there were many Commands for it under the Old Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.2, 3. and 96.1. and 100. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſang before <hi>David</hi>'s time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. <hi>David</hi> compoſed Pſalms by the Spirit to be ſung publickly, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.1, 2. yea, privately too, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.2. Other Songs alſo were made upon ſeveral Occaſions, and uſed whether they were parts of the Scripture or no; as <hi>Solomon</hi> made, 1005. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4.32. And they made Songs upon occaſion, which teacheth that it is lawful for us to do ſo, ſo they be according to the Word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.9, 14. The matter of Scripture may be ſung, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.54. Chriſt and his Diſciples ſang a Hymn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. ſuppoſed to be one of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Pſalms; and they were written for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as well as other parts of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and ſo to be uſed now in ſinging. They ſpeak of the things of the New Teſtament, either figuratively or clearly; and we may underſtand them better now, than the <hi>Jews</hi> could under the Old Teſtament, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans heretofore practiſed this Duty as well as <hi>Jews, Act.</hi> 16.25. Hence their <hi>Antelucani Hymni</hi> were noted by <hi>Pliny</hi> a Heathen. Theſe Songs or Hymns may be uſed at all times, eſpecially for holy Mirth or Rejoycing, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. But is not

               <p>But the right manner of this Duty is chiefly to be noted, and here 1.

Faſts as well as Feaſts are no ſubſtantial parts of Worſhip, becauſe not Spiritual, but Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily. Tho under the Old Teſtament they were parts as inſtituted Rites, figurative and teaching; but that Uſe is now ceaſed; as that on the day of Atonement, and ſo many ſignificative Rites adjoyned to Faſting, as Sackcloth, Aſhes, Rending Garments, pouring out Water, lying on the Earth; the Kingdom of God conſiſts not in theſe things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. the Soul is <hi>hardned by truſting in them,</hi> Iſa. 58.3, 6. Zech. 7.5, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Uſe them as helps to extraordinary Prayer and Humiliation, that the mind-may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited for it, by Eating, Drinking, or bodily Pleaſures, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12-13. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10, 14. It is good only as a help to the Soul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Impediments. The beſt Faſt is, when the Mind is taken off from delights, as in <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſts Caſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.4. when Heaven and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sorrow takes off the Soul, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Uſe it in ſuch a meaſure as may be proper for its End, without which its worth nothing.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96243:164"/>If Abſtinence divert your mind, by reaſon of a gnawing Appetite, then you had better eat ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, as <hi>Daniel</hi> in his great Faſt, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. Some have not enough of ſpiritual-mindedneſs to give up themſelves to Faſting and Prayer, without greater diſtraction; and ſuch had better eat, than go beyond their ſtrength in a thing not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, which produceth only a ſlaviſh Act, as in the Caſe of Virginity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7, 8, 9, 34, 35, 36. Chriſt would not have his weak Diſciples neceſſitated to the Duty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.14, 15. In the mean time, ſuch ſhould ſtrive to be ſenſible of the weakneſs and carnality that hinders their uſe of this excellent Help.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You may expect here ſomething to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Vows, but I ſhall only ſay this of them, Think not to bring your ſelves to good by Vows and Promiſes, as if the ſtrength of your own Law could do it, when the ſtrength of Gods Law doth it not. We bring Children to make promiſes of amendment, but we know how well they keep them. The Devil will urge to Vow, and then to break, that he may perplex your Conſcience the more.</p>
               <p n="8">8ly. Another great means is Fellowſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Saints, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This means muſt be uſed diligently: Whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God ſaveth ſhould be added to ſome Viſible Church, and come into Communion of other Saints; and if they have not opportunity for it, their Heart ſhould be bent towards it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Church is in the Wilderneſs, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from Viſible Communion and Ordinances: But they that Believe in Chriſt are always willing and deſirous ſo to add and joyn themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:96243:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>2.41, 44, 47. and they continued <hi>ſtedfaſtly in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.19. And God binds his People to leave the Fellowſhip and Society of the wicked as much as may be, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. And ſo far as we are neceſſitated to accompany with them, we ought to ſhew <hi>Charity</hi> to their Souls and Bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. This Communion with Saints is to be exerciſed in private Converſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.4, 5, 6, 7. and in publick Aſſemblies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.16, 17.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſs it ought to be uſed for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of Holineſs, as may be proved Firſt in General:</p>
               <p>Becauſe God communicates all Salvation to a People ordinarily by, or in a Church, either by taking them into Fellowſhip, or holding forth the Light of Truth by his Churches to the World. A Church is the <hi>Temple of God,</hi> where God dwells, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. He hath placed his Name and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation there, as in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.32. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.5, 6. He hath given to his Churches thoſe Officers and Ordinances whereby he Converts others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. His Springs are there, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. He makes the ſeveral Members of a Church, Inſtruments for the Conveyance of his Grace and Fulneſs from one to another, as the Members of the Natural Body convey to each other the fulneſs of the Head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.16. All the <hi>New-born</hi> are brought forth and nouriſhed by the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.8, 10. <hi>ch.</hi> 49.20. <hi>&amp;</hi> 60.4. And therefore all that would be ſaved ſhould joyn to a Church: <hi>They ſhall proſper that love the Church, ſo as to ſtand in its Gates, and unite as Members, Brethren and Companions,</hi> Pſal. 122.2, 4, 6. And wrath is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thoſe that are not Members of it,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96243:165"/>at leaſt of the myſtical Body; <hi>They cannot have God for their Father, that have not That for their Mother,</hi> Can. 1.7, 8. This maketh thoſe that deſire Fellowſhip with God, to take hold of the Skirts of his People, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In particular, Fellowſhip with the Saints, conduceth to Holineſs many ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By manifold helps to Holineſs which are received thereby. As 1. The Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. And all the Miniſterial Office and Labour in watching over Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.6. None of theſe Helps can be enjoyed without Fellowſhip of Saints, each with other; and if Believers had been to have ſtood ſingle by themſelves, and not maintained Fellowſhip with each other, for mutual Aſſiſtance and common Good, none of theſe things could have continued, neither could any Believer been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at this day, in an ordinary way, but even the very Name of Believers had been Aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mutual Prayer, which is the more forcible when all pray together, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.19, 20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10, 11. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Mutual Admonition, Inſtruction, Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to help each other when they are ready to fall, and to promote the good work in each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>He that walketh with the wiſe ſhall be wiſe,</hi> Prov. 13.20. <hi>Wo to him that is alone when he falleth.</hi> See <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.9, 12. In Church-Fellowſhip there are many Helpers, many to watch: Soldiers have their Security in Company, and the Church is compared to an Army with Banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. So for quickning Affections, <hi>Iron
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96243:165"/>ſharpneth Iron,</hi> Prov. 27.17. Likewiſe <hi>the counſel of a friend, like ointment and perfume, rejoyceth the heart,</hi> Prov. 27.9. Yea, the Wounds and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs of the Righteous, are as precious Balm, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. External Supports which mitigate Afflictions, and are to be communicated mutually, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.9, 10. The Affliction is increaſed, when none careth for our Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 142.4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Excommunication when Offences are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hainous, or Men obſtinate in ſin. This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is appointed for the deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. Better and more hopeful it is, to be caſt out by the Church for a perſons amendment, than to be wholly without the Church at all times; and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a loſt Sheep, than a Goat or Swine. For Excommunication cuts off Actual Communion only, until Repentance be evident, and not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely aboliſheth the Title and Relation of a Brother and Church-member, tho it judgeth one to be an unnatural Brother, and a pernicious rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Member at preſent, not fit for Acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Beſides, Admonition, which is ſtill to be afforded, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.15. and any means is to be uſed, that may ſerve to Cure and reſtore him; the Church reacheth forth a Hand to help ſuch a perſon, tho they do not joyn Hands in Fellowſhip with him; or it communicateth to him, not with him. Yet if he have not ſo much Grace as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, it were better he had never known the <hi>way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.21.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The lively Examples of Saints are before our Eyes in Church-fellowſhip, to teach and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. <hi>ch.</hi> 4.9. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.10, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:96243:166"/>
               <p n="2">2ly. By thoſe holy Duties that are required, and do appertain to this Fellowſhip and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; all Acts that belong to this Fellowſhip are Holy, as Hearing, receiving the Sacraments, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, mutual Admonitions, &amp;c. I ſhall conſider ſome ſuch holy Acts, whereby we are rather doers than receivers, and which we perform towards others. As 1. Godly Diſcourſe, Teaching, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, Comforting others in Chriſt; which we cannot ſo perform towards others, as towards thoſe we have ſtrict Fellowſhip with in Chriſt. Others like Swine, trample theſe Jewels under Foot; and Saints therefore are forced to refrain from Godly Diſcourſe in their Company, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.10, 13, 16. and 6.10. But holy Diſcourſe is moſt acceptable to the Saints, and to be practiſed with them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. and is greatly to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Holineſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In helping, ſuccouring, and converſing with Chriſt in his Members, we do good to Chriſt in his Members in Church-fellowſhip; and we our ſelves as Members of Chriſt, Act as well from Chriſt as towards Chriſt; whereas if we do good to others without, we do good only for Chriſts ſake, but not to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35, 49. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2, 3. We have advantage in general, to do all Duties that belong to us as Members of Chriſt to Fellow-members, which we cannot do if ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them; as a Natural Member cannot perform its Office to other Members if ſeparate from them.</p>
               <p n="2">2ly. The means muſt be uſed rightly, for the attaining of Holineſs only in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. One Rule is, Do not truſt on Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, or on Churches, as if this or that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:96243:166"/>in Fellowſhip, commended you to God of it ſelf; whereas, a Church-way is but a help to Fellowſhip with Chriſt, and walking in the Duties of that Fellowſhip. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſtumbled at Chriſt by truſting on their Carnal Priviledges, and ſet them in oppoſition to Chriſt; whereas they ſhould have only made them ſubſervient to Chriſt: Confidence in them ſhould have bin abandoned, as <hi>Pauls</hi> example teacheth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3, 4, 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We muſt not Glory in <hi>Paul, Apollos, Cephas,</hi> but in Chriſt, elſe we Glory in the Fleſh, and in Men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12, 13. &amp; 3.21. Truſting on Church-priviledges, is an inlett to Formality and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4, 8, 9, 10. and thence the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Churches, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Follow no Church any further than you may follow it in the way of Chriſt; and keep Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with it only upon the Account of Chriſt, becauſe it follows Chriſt, and hath Fellowſhip with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.23. If a Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from Chriſt, we muſt not follow it how an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſoever it be, as the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Church was not to be followed when it perſecuted Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and many by adhering to that Church fell from Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.13, 14. &amp; 21.28. We are indeed to hear the Church, but not every one that calls it ſelf ſo, nor none, any ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it ſpeaketh as a true Church, according to the Voice of the Shepherd, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27. We muſt ſubject our ſelves to Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of his Myſteries, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. But muſt give up your ſelves firſt to Chriſt abſolutely, and to the Church according to the Will of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. Our Fear muſt not be taught by the Precepts of Men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. The Doctrins of any
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96243:167"/>Men are to be tryed by Scripture, whatever Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they pretend to, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. An unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted following Church-guides, brought the Church into <hi>Babylon,</hi> and into all manner of ſpiritual Whoredoms and Abominations. You are not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Name of the Church, but into the Name of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do not think that you muſt attain this or that Degree of Grace, before you joyn your ſelf in full Communion with a Church of Chriſt in all Ordinances; but when you have given up your ſelf to Chriſt and learn't the Duty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, give up your ſelf unto a Church of Chriſt, though you find much Weakneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability. For Church Ordinances of ſpecial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, ſerve to ſtrengthen you, and how can you get Heat being alone? The Diſciples as ſoon as converted, embraced all Fellowſhip, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. And Churches, that they may forward Holineſs in themſelves and others, muſt be willing to receive Chriſts weak ones, and to feed his Lambs as well as better grown Sheep, and <hi>bear them on their ſides,</hi> Iſa. 66.12. how elſe ſhall Chriſts weak ones grow ſtrong by that Nouriſhment that other parts ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? They are very unreaſonable that expect that Chriſtians ſhould grow out of Church Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to as high a Degree of Grace, as thoſe that are in thoſe Paſtures of tender Graſs, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to receive any that they are like to have occaſion to bear with; whereas <hi>bearing</hi> and <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering,</hi> are great Duties of Church-Fellowſhip, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. The Weakeſt have moſt need to be ſtrengthened by Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and we are bound to receive them, as Chriſt hath received us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.7. We do not reject
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:96243:167"/>or ſeparate the weaker parts of the Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.23, 24. but put more Honour and Comlineſs on them. Admiſſion into the Churches in the Apoſtolick times, was gained upon Profeſſion, with a ſhew of Seriouſneſs, though Tares got in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Wheat, and many Scandals aroſe to the Reproach of the ways of Chriſt, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Strictneſs will not keep out all Hypocrites; yet the beſt care muſt be taken ſo far, as not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any that have the leaſt truth of Grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Keep Communion with a Church, for the ſake of Communion with Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.23. Therefore you muſt keep Communion in Chriſts pure ways only, and in them ſeek Chriſt by Faith, that in the Enjoyment of thoſe Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, you may receive, and act the Godlineſs and Holineſs formentioned, and aim at ſpiritual Flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Growth in Grace: Chuſe therefore Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the moſt ſpiritual Churches; judge of Churches and Men, according to the rule of the <hi>new creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16, 17. <hi>and try them,</hi> Rev. 2.2. and 3.9. otherwiſe a Church may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ye. See that thy Communion anſwer its end, tend to thy Edification, not to Deſtruction; which you ought to take all the Advantages of, not only in the Church where you are a Member, but by Communion with other Churches, as occaſionally Providence caſts you among them. For your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a particular Church, obligeth to Communion with all Churches of Chriſt in his ways, as you are called thereto, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.17. And it's an Abuſe to ſay we are Members of a Church in <hi>London,</hi> and therefore refuſe Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with a Church in the Country; ſeeing if we are Members of Chriſt, we are Members of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:96243:168"/>whether ſingle Perſons or Churches. And endeavour to joyn in Fellowſhip with the Godly of the place where you live, that you may have the more ſequent and conſtant Communion. <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> though converted at <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt be one of the Church of the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> becauſe he lived there, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.9. compare with <hi>Philemon,</hi> 10. The Union of the Saints together in diſtinct Societies, according to the places where they lived, was the Apoſtolick Practice, and can't be violated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin. Such can beſt Watch over one another, Admoniſh, Comfort, and Edify each other, which is the benefit of Communion; and they indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Communion, that ſeek a Communion where they can't have this Benefit. I only add to this Head, That Church-Fellowſhip without practiſing the ways of Chriſt, is but a Conſpiracy to take his Name in vain, and a counterfeit Church-Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Hypocrites; it is Impudency for ſuch to invite others to their Communion, Tyranny to compell them. Every Chriſtian is bound to ſeek a better Church-Fellowſhip by Reformation; and thoſe that do ſo, are the beſt Sons of Chriſt's Church, who enquire, Is this the way to enjoy Chriſt, a Church-way being appointed to enjoy Chriſt therein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Eſpecially leave not the Church in Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when you need its Help moſt, and are then moſt tryed whether you will cleave to it: This is a ſign of Apoſtaſie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.9.10, 12, 13. We ſhould cleave to one another as one Fleſh, even to Priſons and Death; or elſe we deny Chriſt in his Members, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.43.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <head>EXPLANATION.</head>
               <p>THis Direction may ſerve as an Epilogue or Concluſion, by ſtirring us up unto a lively and chearful Imbracing theſe Goſpel Rules fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned by ſeveral weighty Motives. As many are kept from ſeeking Godlineſs becauſe they know not the way to it, or the way that they think of, ſeems Uncouth, Unpleaſant, Diſadvantageous and full of Diſcouragement; like the way through the Wilderneſs to <hi>Canaan,</hi> which wearied the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> and occaſioned their many <hi>murmurings,</hi> Num. 21.4.</p>
               <p>But this is a way ſo good and excellent, that thoſe that have the true Knowledge of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire heartily to be Godly, can't diſlike it. I ſhall ſhew the Excellency of it in ſeveral Particulars; but you ſhould firſt call to mind what is the way that I have taught, <hi>viz.</hi> Union and Fellowſhip with Chriſt, and by Faith in Chriſt, as diſcovered in the Goſpel; not by the Law, or in a natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or by thinking to get it before we come to Chriſt, to procure Chriſt by it, which is ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:96243:169"/>againſt the Stream: But that we muſt firſt apply Chriſt and his Salvation to our ſelves for our Comfort, and that by confident Faith, and then walk by that Faith according to the New Man in Chriſt, and not as in a natural Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and uſe all means of Holineſs rightly for this end. Now that this is an excellent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous way, appears by the following deſirable Properties of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It hath this Property, that it tends to the Abaſement of all Fleſh, and Exaltation of God only in his Grace and Power through Chriſt; and ſo it is agreeable to Gods deſign in all his Works, and the end that he aimeth at, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.21, 22.31.32. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.4. and a fit means for the attaining the end that we ought to aim at in the firſt place, which is the Hallowing, Sanctifying and Glorifying Gods Name in all things; and is the firſt and chief Petition, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. and is the end of all our Actings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. was the end of giving the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19, 20. God made all things for Chriſt, and would have him have the Preheminence in all, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.17, 18. That the Father may be glorified in the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13. And this Property of it, is a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove that it is the way of God, and hath the Character of his Image ſtamped upon it; we may ſay that it is <hi>like him,</hi> and a way accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Heart, as Chriſt proveth his Doctrin to be of God by this Argument, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.18. And <hi>Paul</hi> proveth the Doctrin of Juſtification, and of Sanctification, and Salvation by Grace through Faith to be of God, becauſe it excludes all boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29.30, 31. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8, 9. This Property appears
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:96243:169"/>evidently in the Myſtery of Sanctification by Chriſt in us through Faith. For firſt, It ſheweth that we can do nothing by our natural Will, or any Power of the Fleſh; and that God will not enable us to do any thing that way, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. however Nature be ſtirred up by the Law or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Helps, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.21. And ſo it ſerveth to work Self-loathing and Abaſement, and to make us look upon Nature, as deſperately wicked and paſt cure, and to be put off; not reformed by putting on Chriſt: It remains wicked, and only wicked, after we have put on Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſheweth that all our good Works and living to God, are not by our own Power and Strength at all; but by the Power of Chriſt, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in us by Faith, and that God enableth us to act, not meerly according to our natural Power, as he enableth carnal Men and all other Creatures, but above our own Power by Chriſt united to us and in us through the Spirit: All Men live, move, and have their Being in him, and by his univerſal Support and Maintenance of Nature; in its Being and Activity they act, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. So that the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Acting as Creatures belongs to God, but God acts more immediately in his People, who are one Fleſh and Spirit with Chriſt, and act not by their own Power, but by the Power of the Spirit of Chriſt in them, as cloſely united to him, and being the living Temple of his Spirit; ſo that Chriſt is the immediate principal Agent of all their good Works, and they are Chriſts Works properly, who works all our Works in us and for us, and yet they are the Saints Works by Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with Chriſt, by whoſe Light and Power the Faculties of the Saints do act and are acted,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96243:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16, 17. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.1. ſo we are to aſcribe all our works to God in Chriſt, and thank him for them as free Gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11. God inableth us to act not by our ſelves, as he doth others but by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Wicked are ſupported in acting only according to their own Nature; ſo they act wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly: Thus all are ſaid to live, move, and have their being in God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. But God ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth us to conquer Sin, not by our ſelves, but by himſelf, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.7. and the Glory of inabling us, doth not only belong to him which the Phariſee could not but aſcribe to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11. but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Glory of doing all in us; and yet we work as one with Chriſt, even as he works as one with the Father, by the Father working in him: We act as Branches by the Juice of the Vine, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by the animal Spirits of the Head, and bring forth Fruit by Marriage to him as our Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and Work in the Strength of him as the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bread that we feed on, he is all in the new Man, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.11. and all the Promiſes are made good in him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath this Property, that it conſiſteth well with other Doctrins of the Goſpel, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Errors do not, and hence this is the way to confirm us in many other Points of the Goſpel, and therefore appears to be true by its Harmony with other truths, and ſit linking with them in the ſame golden Chain of the myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and evidenceth them to be true by their Harmony with it. I have ſhewed that mens mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaking the true Way of Sanctification, is the cauſe of perverting the Scripture in other Points of Faith, and of declining from the Truth to Popiſh
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:96243:170"/>Socinian and Arminian Tenents: Becauſe Men cannot ſeriouſly take that for truth, which they judge not to be according to Godlineſs. But this Way of Holineſs will evidence that thoſe Goſpel Doctrins which they refuſe, are according to Godlineſs, and that thoſe Tenents which a blind Zeal for Holineſs moveth them to embrace, are indeed contrary to Holineſs. However Satan appeareth to their natural Underſtandings as an Angel of light in ſuch Tenents: Whatever Men ſay, its certain that Legaliſts are indeed the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inſtance in ſome Truths confirmed by it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctrin of original Sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and a corrupt Nature, but utter Impotency to do ſpiritual good, and Proneneſs to Sin, which is Death to God in all People according to nature, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. There is an utter Inability to keep the Law tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in any Point. Many deny this Doctrin becauſe they think that if People believe this, they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their Sins by it, and be apt to deſpair of all ſtriving to do good Works, and leave off all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and grow licentious; and they think it will be more conducing to Godlineſs, to hold and teach either, that there is no original Sin or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption derived from <hi>Adam,</hi> or at leaſt it is done away, either in the World, by univerſal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or in the Church by Baptiſm; and that there is free-will reſtored, whereby People are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to encline themſelves to do good, that Men may be more encouraged to ſet upon good Works, and their Neglect made inexcuſable. All this is indeed forcible againſt ſeeking and endeavouring
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96243:171"/>for Holineſs, by the free-will and power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the way of endeavouring, which I directed you to avoid, and if there were no new Way to Holineſs ſince the fall, original Sin might make us deſpair; but there is a new Birth, a new Heart, a new Creature, and therefore we have directed to ſeeking of Holineſs by the Spirit of Chriſt, and willing good freely by a ſpiritual Power as new Creatures, partakers of a divine Nature in Chriſt. Yea, its neceſſary to know the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that we may know the ſecond, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. To believe the fall and original Sin, that we may be ſtirred up to fly to Chriſt by Faith for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs by free Gift, knowing that we cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it by our own Power and Free Will, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12, 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. There were no need of a new Man or a new Creation, if the old were not without ſtrength and Life, <hi>Joh</hi> 3.5, 6, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. But original Deadneſs cannot hinder Gods working Faith and Hungrings and Thirſtings after Chriſt, by the Spirit, through the Goſpel, in thoſe that God chooſeth to walk holily and blameleſsly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in Love, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. And ſo we are made alive in a new Head, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Branches of another Vine, living to God by the Spirit, not by Nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It confirms us in the Doctrin of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which many deny, becauſe they ſay it takes Men off from Endeavours as fruitleſs, by telling Men that all Events are predetermined. This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would be more forcible againſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, by the power of our own Free Will, but not at all againſt Endeavours for Holineſs, by the Operation of God, giving us Faith and all Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96243:171"/>by his own Spirit, working in us through Chriſt, we are to truſt on Chriſt for the Grace of the Elect, and Gods good Will towards Men, <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.4, 5. Election by Grace deſtroys ſeeking by Works, but not by Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5, 6. And we are here taught to ſeek for Salvation only in the way of the Elect; and we may conclude that Holineſs is to be had by Gods Will, and not by our own; and it may move us to deſire Holineſs by the Will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.32. And ſeeing it appears by this Doctrin of Sanctification through Chriſt, that we are Gods Workmanſhip as to all the good wrought in us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. We may well admit that he hath appointed his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from Eternity, without infringing the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty of our corrupt Wills, which reacheth not unto good Works, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. compare with 30. Mans Natural Free Will may well conſiſt with Gods Decree as in Paradiſe, <hi>Decretum radii contingentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It confirms us in the true Doctrin of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Reconciliation with God by Faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the Merits of Chriſts Blood, without any Works of our own, and without conſidering Faith as a Work to procure Favour by the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Act, but only as a Hand to receive the Gift, or rather as the very Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt actually, than any kind of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intitling us to him as our Food. This great Doctrin of the Goſpel many hate, as breaking the ſtrongeſt Bonds of Holineſs, and opening a way to all Licentiouſneſs; for they reckon that the Conditionality of Works, to attain Gods Favour, and avoid his Wrath, and the neceſſity of them
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96243:172"/>to Salvation, are the moſt neceſſary and effectual Impulſives to all Holineſs; and they account that the other Doctrin opens the Flood-gates to Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs. And truly this Conſideration would be of ſome weight, if People were to be brought to Holineſs by Moral Suaſion, and their natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſtirred up by the Terms of the Law, and by ſlaviſh Fears, and Mercenary Hopes; for the Force of theſe Motives would be altogether enervated by the Doctrin of Juſtification by Free Grace; but I have already ſhewed, that a Man being a guilty dead Creature, cannot be brought to ſerve God out of love, by force of any of theſe Motives, and that we are not ſanctified by any of our own Endeavours, to work Holineſs in our ſelves, but rather by Faith in Chriſt's Death and Reſurrection, even the ſame whereby we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified; and that the urging of the Law ſtirs up Sin; and that Freedom from it is neceſſary to all Holineſs, as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11, 14. and 7.4, 5. And this way of Sanctification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Doctrin of Juſtification by Faith, as the Apoſtle informeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. For if we are San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and ſo reſtored to the Image of God and Life by the Spirit through Faith, it is evident that God hath taken us into his Favour, and pardoned our Sins by the ſame Faith, without the Law, or elſe we ſhould not have the Fruits and Effects of his Favour thereby to our eternal Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. Yea, his Juſtice would not admit his giving Life without Works, if we were not made Righteous in Chriſt by the ſame Faith. And we cannot truſt to have Holineſs freely given us by Chriſt upon any rational Ground; except we can alſo truſt on the ſame Chriſt for free Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:96243:172"/>and Forgiveneſs of Sins for our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Neither can guilty curſed Creatures, that cannot work by reaſon of their Deadneſs under the Curſe, be brought to a rational love of God, except they apprehend his loving them firſt freely without Works, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. The great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Reaſon of ſo many Controverſies and Books written about it is, becauſe they think that Men will truſt to be ſaved however they live: But Sanctification is an Effect of Juſtification, and floweth from the ſame Grace; and we truſt for them both by the ſame Faith, and for the former in order to the latter: And ſuch a Faith, be it never ſo confident, tendeth not to Licentiouſneſs, but Holineſs. And we grant that Juſtification by Grace deſtroys Holineſs by legal Endeavours, but not by Grace: So that there is no need to live a <hi>Papiſt</hi> and die an <hi>Antinomian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It confirms us in the Doctrin of Real Union with Chriſt, ſo plentifully held forth in Scripture, which Doctrin ſome count a vain Notion, and cannot endure it, becauſe they think it worketh not Holineſs, but Preſumption; whereas I have ſhewed that it is abſolutely neceſſary for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Spiritual Life and Holineſs, which is treaſured up in Chriſt, and that ſo inſeparably, that we cannot have it without a real Union with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.12. <hi>John</hi> 6.53. <hi>ch.</hi> 15.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. The Members and Branches cannot live without Union with the Vine and Head; nor the Stones be part of the living Temple, except they be really joyned mediately or immediately to the Corner-ſtone.</p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:96243:173"/>
               <p n="5">5. In the Doctrin of certain final Perſeverance of the Saints, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. <hi>c.</hi> 6.37. &amp; 5.24. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. <hi>John</hi> 10.23, 29. <hi>c.</hi> 4.14. They think this Doctrin maketh People careleſs of good Works. I anſwer, It maketh Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple careleſs of ſeeking them by their own Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Strength, and in a way of ſlaviſh Fear; but careful and couragious in truſting on the Grace of God for them, when they are brought by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration heartily to deſire them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.30. ſetting upon the doing of them in that Grace, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.8, 11. And I have ſhewed that all fears of Damnation will never bring Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to work out of love; and that nothing will do it, but a comfortable Doctrin.</p>
               <p n="3">3ly. It hath this excellent Property, that it is a Never-failing, effectually powerful, alone Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and ſure way to attain to true Holineſs: They that have the Truth in them, find it, and the truly humbled find it: People ſtrive in vain, when they ſeek it any other way; therefore ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the Lepers, elſe you die, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, 3, 7. All other ways either ſtir up Sin, or increaſe Deſpair in you; as ſeeking Holineſs by the Law, and working under the Curſe doth; and breeds but Slaviſh and Hypocritical Obedience at beſt, and reſtrains Sin only inſtead of mortifying it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.25. The Jews ſought another way and could not attain it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. And all that ſeek it another way <hi>ſhall lye down in Sorrow,</hi> Iſa. 50.11. And that 1. Becauſe as we are under the Law in our Natural Eſtate, we are Dead and <hi>Children of Wrath, Eph.</hi> 2.1, 3. And the Law curſeth us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of helping us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. and giveth no Life by its Obligation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21. And we cannot
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96243:173"/>work Holineſs in our ſelves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. So that an humbled Perſon finds it in vain, to ſeek Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Law or his own Strength; for the Law is weak through our Fleſh; ſeeking a pure Life, without a pure Nature, is building without a Foundation; and no ſeeking a new Nature from the Law, for it bids make Brick without Straw; and ſaith to the Cripple Walk, without giving any Strength. 2. In this way only God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us, even in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. And ſo he loves us, and is a fit Object of our Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. And ſo in this way only we have a new and Divine Nature by the Spirit of Chriſt in us, effectually carrying us forth to Holineſs with Life and Love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4 and have new Hearts according to the Law, ſo that we ſerve God heartily according to the new Nature, and cannot but ſerve him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. So that here is a ſure Foundation for Godlineſs and love to God, with all our Heart, Might and Soul; and Sin is not only reſtrained but mortified; and not only the outſide made clean, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and the Image of God renewed, and Holy Actings ſurely follow: We Sin not according to the new Nature, though we are not perfect in degree, becauſe of the old Nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4ly. It is a moſt pleaſant way to thoſe that are in it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. and that in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a moſt plain way, eaſie to be found, to one that ſeeth his own Deadneſs under the Law, and is ſo renewed in the Spirit of his Mind, as to know and be perſwaded of the Truth of the Goſpel; though ſuch may be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:96243:174"/>and peſtered with many legal Thoughts and Workings; yet when they ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things, the way is ſo plain, that they think it Folly and Madneſs to go any other way: So that the wayfaring Man, though a Fool, doth do not err therein, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.9. The enlightned Soul cannot think of another way when truly humbled, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.8. And when we are in Chriſt, we have his Spirit to be our Guide in this way, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>John</hi> 16.13. So that we need not be filled with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting Thoughts about knowledge of our way, as legal Spirits are about Thouſands of Caſes of Conſcience, which do ſo multiply upon them, that they deſpair of finding out the way of Religion, by reaſon of ſo various Doubts and manifold Intricacies. Here we may be ſure that God will ſo far teach us our Duties, as that we ſhall not be miſled with Error, ſo as to continue in it to Deſtruction, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25.8, 9, 14. What a trouble is it to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller to be doubtful of his way, and without a Guide, when his Buſineſs is of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, upon Life and Death, it is even an Heart-breaking: But thoſe that are in this way, may be ſure, that though they ſometime err, yet they ſhall not err deſtructively, but ſhall diſcern their way again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7, 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is eaſie to thoſe that walk in it by the Spirit, though it be difficult to get into it by reaſon of the Oppoſition of the Fleſh or Devil ſcaring us, or ſeducing us from it. Here you have Holineſs as a Free Gift received by Faith, an Act of the Mind and Soul; whoſoever
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96243:174"/>will, may come, take it and drink freely, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is required but a willing mind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.38. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. But the Law is an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Burden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. if Duty be laid on by its Terms. We are not left in this way to conquer Luſts by our Endeavours, which is a ſucceſsleſs Work, but what is Duty is given, and the Law is turned into Promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. &amp; 32.40. We have all now in Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. and 2.9, 10, 15.17. This is a Catholick Medicine inſtead of a Thouſand. How pleaſant would this Free-gift Holineſs be to us, if we knew our own Wants, and Inabilities and Sinfulneſs? How ready are ſome to Toyle continually, and macerate their Bodies in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy legal way, to get Holineſs rather than periſh for ever? and therefore how ready ſhould we be, when it is only Take and Have, Believe and be Sanctifyed and Saved, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.13. Chriſts <hi>burden is light</hi> by his Spirit bearing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.30. No wearineſs, <hi>but renewing of ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 40 31.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a <hi>way of Peace,</hi> Prov. 3.17. free from Fears and Terrors of Conſcience, that thoſe meet with unavoidably that ſeek Salvation by Works; <hi>for the Law worketh wrath,</hi> Rom. 4.15. It is not the way of <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> but of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Heb. 12.18, 22. The Doubts of Salvation that People meet with, ariſe from putting ſome condition of Works betwixt Chriſt and themſelves, as hath appeared in this Diſcourſe; but our walking in this way, is by Ftith, which rejects ſuch Fears and Doubtings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 5.36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 22. It's free from Fears of Satan or any
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96243:175"/>Evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.31, 32. And free from ſlaviſh Fears of periſhing by our Sins, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6, 7. it laying hold on infinite Grace, Mercy and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſecure us: <hi>The Lord is the Keeper and Shade on the right hand,</hi> Pſal. 121.5. Free and powerful Grace anſwers all Objections.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a way that is <hi>paved with Love,</hi> like <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> Chariot, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.10. We are to ſet Gods loving-kindneſs, and all the gifts of his Love, ſtill before our eyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.2. Chriſts Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, Interceſſion before our eyes; which breed <hi>Peace, Joy, Hope, Love,</hi> Rom. 15.13. Iſa. 35.10. You muſt Believe for your Juſtification, Adoption, the Gift of the Spirit, and a future Inheritance; your Death and Reſurrection with Chriſt: In Believing for theſe things, your whole way is adorned with Flowers, and hath theſe Fruits growing on each ſide; ſo that it's through the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> rather than <hi>the Wilderneſs of</hi> Sinai, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.31. It is the Office of the Spirit our Guide, to be our Comforter, and not a <hi>Spirit of bondage,</hi> Rom. 8.15. Peace and Joy are great Duties in this way, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. God doth not drive us on with Whips and Terrors, and by the Rod of the Schoolmaſter of the Law; but leads us and wins us to walk in his ways, by Allurements, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. See ſuch Alurements, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>c.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our very Moving, Acting, Walking in this way, is a Pleaſure and Delight; every good Work is done with Pleaſure, the very Labour of the way is pleaſant. Carnal Men wiſh Duties were not neceſſary, and they are burthenſome to them; but they are pleaſant to us, becauſe we do not
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96243:175"/>gain Holineſs by our own carnal Wreſtling with our Luſts, and croſſing them out of carnal Fear, with Regret and Grief, and ſetting Conſcience and the Law againſt them, to hinder their Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but we act naturally, according to the New Nature, and perform our own New ſpiritual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Luſts, by walking in the ways of God through Chriſt: And our Luſts and Pleaſures in Sin, are not only reſtrained, but taken away in Chriſt; and Pleaſures in Holineſs, freely given us and implanted in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17, 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.34. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.14, 16, 20. We have a new Taſte and Savour, Love, Luſt and Liking by the Spirit of Chriſt, and look on the Law, not as a Burden, but as our Priviledge in Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a high exalted way above all other ways: Unto this way the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk</hi> is exalted, when upon the Failure of all viſible Helps and Supports, he reſolves to <hi>rejoyce in the Lord, and joy in the God of his Salvation;</hi> and making God his Strength by Faith, <hi>his Feet ſhould be as Hinds Feet, and ſhould walk upon his high places,</hi> Hab. 3.18, 19. Theſe are the <hi>heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, that God hath ſet us in, being quickned and raiſed up toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him,</hi> Eph. 2.5, 6.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We live high here, <hi>for we live not by the fleſh, but by the Spirit, and Chriſt in us, with all his fullneſs,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 2. Gal. 2.20. c. 5.25. We walk in Fellowſhip with God, dwelling in us, and walking about in us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. And therefore our Works are of higher Price and Excellency, than the Works of others, becauſe they are wrought in God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. And are the Fruits of Gods
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:96243:176"/>Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.11. And we may know that they are accepted and good, by our Goſpel Principles which others have not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are inabled to the moſt difficult Duties, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.1, 3. and nothing is too hard for us. See the great Works done by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.23. Works that carnal Men think! Folly and Madneſs to venture upon, (they are ſo great) and honourable Atchievements, in doing and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We walk in an honourable State with God, and on honourable Terms; not as guilty Creatures to get our Pardon by Works, nor as Bond-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to earn our Meat and Drink; but as Sons and Heirs, walking towards the full Poſſeſſion of that Happineſs to which we have a Title, and ſo we have much boldneſs in Gods Preſence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6, 7. We can approach nearer to God than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and walk before him conſidently without ſlaviſh Fear; not as Strangers, but as ſuch who are of his own Family, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20. And this prompts us to doing greater things than others; <hi>walking as free Men,</hi> Rom. 6.17, 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.35, 36. It is a Kingly way; the Law to us, is a Royal Law, a Law of Liberty and our Priviledge, not a Bond and Yoak of Compulſion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is the way only of thoſe that are Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Precious in the eyes of the Lord, even his Elect and Redeemed ones, whoſe ſpecial Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge it is, to walk therein; <hi>No unclean Beast goeth there,</hi> Jer. 35.8, 9. No carnal Man can walk in this way, but only thoſe that are <hi>taught of God,</hi> Joh. 6.44, 45, 46. Nor would it have come into our Hearts, without Divine Revelation.</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:96243:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p n="5">5. The preparing this way, coſt Chriſt very dear; it is a coſtly way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is a good old way, wherein thou mayeſt follow the Footſteps of all the Flock.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It's the way to Perfection, it leads to ſuch Holineſs, which ſhall in a while, be abſolutely perfect: It differs only in the degree and manner of Manifeſtation from the Holineſs of Heaven; there the Saints live by the ſame Spirit, and the ſame God in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. And have the Image of the ſame ſpiritual Man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. Only here we <hi>have but the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.23. <hi>And live by faith and not by ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. <hi>And are not full grown in Christ,</hi> Eph. 4.13. Sanctification in Chriſt, is Glorification begun, as Glorification is Sanctification perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

            <p>So the Words are a declaration of the Goſpel way of Juſtification, by the Righteouſneſs of God; and that ſo clearly and fully, and the benefit ſpoken of ſo great, and glorious, being the firſt benefit that we receive by Union with Chriſt and the foundation of all other benefits; that my Text is accounted to be <hi>Evangelium Evangelii,</hi> a principal part of the written Goſpel, as briefly and yet fully expreſſing this excellent point more then any other Text.</p>
            <p>Note in the words particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Subject declared and explained, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification of Perſons, or their being juſtified; and the meaning of it here is to be cleared and freed from all Ambiguities and Miſ-underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Juſtification ſignifieth making juſt, as San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is making holy, Glorification making glorious. But not making juſt by infuſion of grace and holineſs into a Perſon, as the Papiſts teach conſounding Juſtification and Sanctification to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but making juſt in trial and judgment, by a judicial Sentence diſcharging of guilt, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from blame and accuſation; approving, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96243:180"/>owning and pronouncing a perſon to be righteous. Uſe alters the ſignification from the Notation. It is a Juridical word or Law Term, and hath reference to Trial and Judgement, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. <hi>It is with me a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you, or of man's judgment: Yea I judge not mine own ſelf. For I know nothing of my ſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified; but he that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me is the Lord.</hi> And its ſo oppoſed to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in Judgment, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.1. <hi>If there be a controverſie between men, and they come unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the Judges may judge them, then they ſhall juſtify the Righteous, and condemn the wicked.</hi> And Mat. 12.37. <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> And it's op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed both to Accuſation and Condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> ver. 34. <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi> And ſo <hi>Job</hi> 9.20. <hi>If I juſtify my ſelf, mine own mouth ſhall condemn me.</hi> Job 13.15. <hi>I will maintain mine own ways before him.</hi> ver. 18. <hi>I have ordered my cauſe, and I know I ſhall be juſtified.</hi> ver. 19. <hi>Who is he that will plead with me?</hi> Here Juſtification is plainly oppoſed unto the Accuſation or Fault; and it's as plainly oppoſed to the paſſing Sentence of Condemnation, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.32. <hi>Do, and judge thy Servants, condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head, and juſtifying the righteous to give him according to his Righteouſneſs.</hi> In this ſence it is a ſin to juſtify the Wicked, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Job</hi> 27.5. Actions muſt be exiſtent already, and brought to trial that they may be juſtified, <hi>Job</hi> 33.32. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.9, 26.</p>
            <p>Juſtice or Righteouſneſs conſiſts not in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96243:181"/>nature of an Action; but in its agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs to a rule of Judgment; So that Actions are called juſt and righteous by an Extrinſecal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination with relation to Gods rule of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and this Righteouſneſs appears by trying the Action according to the rule, and by making an eſtimate of it; which eſtimate is either appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or diſproving, juſtifying or condemning, finding it to be ſin or no ſin, or breach of the Law; ſo we may ſay of the righteouſneſs of Perſons, with reference to ſuch habits or actings. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Righteouſneſs of righteous Perſons appears when they are brought to trial and judgment, therefore they are ſaid then to be in a ſpecial manner juſtified, as if they were then made righteous; <hi>Viz.</hi> when their Righteouſneſs is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, as Chriſt was ſaid to be begotten the Son of God at the Reſurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 13 33. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was then declared to be the Son of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4 and in the ſame ſenſe we that are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at preſent, are ſaid to wait for our adoption, <hi>i. e.</hi> the manifeſtation of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. And thus even God is ſaid to be juſtified when we judge of his Actions as we ought to do, and deem them to be righteous, <hi>Job</hi> 32.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. though nothing can be added to the Infinite Righteouſneſs of God. And Wiſdom is ſaid to be juſtified by her Children, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.19. So Juſtification is not a real change of a Sinner in himſelf, (though a real change is annexed to it) but only a Relative change with reference to Gods Judgment. And thus the word is uſed in the Text, and ſo alſo in matters of Judicature through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſcripture; yea, ſome contend againſt
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96243:181"/>the Papiſts, that it is no where in Scripture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, except by a Trope borrowed from this as the proper ſenſe: And in the Text it's beyond all doubt meant of being deemed and accounted juſt in the ſight of God; for ſuch a Juſtification is here only treated of, as appears in the Text, and before <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. And I have been the longer Explaining the ſenſe of the word, becauſe the miſtaking of it by reaſon of its compoſition oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned that popiſh error, whereby the benefit ſignified by it is obſcured, yea, overthrown; ſo that we had need contend for the ſenſe of the Word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Text we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Firſt, the Perſons ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified: 1. Sinners, 2. Such Sinners of all ſorts that ſhall believe, whether Jews or Gentiles.</p>

            <p>From hence therefore will ariſe ſeveral uſeful Obſervations, all tending to explain the nature of Juſtification, which ſhall be laid down, and cleared out of the Text, and confirmed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and then I ſhall make uſe of them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> I. <hi>They who are juſtified are Sinners, ſuch who are come ſhort of the Glory of God,

            <p n="1">1. The Law condemns all Sinners and ſtrikes them dead as with a Thunderbolt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. and adjudgeth them to Shame, Confuſion, and Miſery, inſtead of Glory and Happineſs, by the ſtrict terms of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. — 9.11, 12. which none fulfils, neither can do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. neither Jews nor Gentiles; there is no hope if free Grace reſtore them not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt came only to ſave Sinners, and died for this end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt dyed for the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave Sinners, of whom I am the chief.</hi> Mat. 9.13. <hi>I am not come to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi> Mat. 18.11. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſave that which is loſt.</hi> And God muſt be believed on to Salvation, as a God that juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Ungodlſy, he muſt believe as one that worketh not, on him that juſtifieth the Ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5.</p>

               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> II. <hi>Sinners of all ſorts, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whether Jews, or Gentiles that believe are the Subjects of this Juſtification.</hi> This is the Scope of the Apoſtle to ſhew that whereas Jews and Gentiles were univerſally condemned by the Light and Law of Nature, or the Law written; ſo the Righteouſneſs of God is upon them all that believe, <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22. without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96243:182"/>This was a great point to be defended againſt the Jews in the Apoſtles times, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated Juſtification to themſelves, in a legal way, and ſuch were Proſelites to the Law and Circumciſion; and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> vehemently urged it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11, 12. and it was a point newly revealed to the Apoſtles, that the Gentiles might be accepted without turning Jews, and much prized as a very Glorious Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.28, 45. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.4, 5, 18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25, 26, 27. and it is confirmed</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe notwithſtanding the Jews priviledg of the Law, by reaſon of breaking the law, they had as much need of Free Juſtification as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and no worthyneſs above the Gentiles by their works, but rather greater ſinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23, 24. and when there is equal need and worth, God might righteouſly juſtify one as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God is the God of the Gentiles as well as the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.29. as he promiſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.9, 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.25. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified before he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, that he might be the Father of thoſe that believe though uncircumciſed, that they might inherit the ſame Bleſſing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will appear further by ſhewing that Juſtification is only by Faith, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon the Law, meerly by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another; and ſo Jews and Gentiles are alike capable of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> III. <hi>That the Juſtifier or efficient cauſe of Juſtification is God.</hi> It's an Act of God, <hi>Rom.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:96243:183"/>8.33. It is God that juſtifieth, he only can juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Authoritatively and Irreverſibly.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. To Him the Debt of ſuffering for Sin, and acting Righteouſneſs is owed: And therefore he only can give a diſcharge for payment, or releaſe of the Debtor, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.7.</p>

               </gap>, freely by his Grace, one of theſe Expreſſions, had been enough, but this redoubling of it ſheweth the Importance of the truth to quicken our attention the more. Here is the Impulſive cauſe of Juſtification, and his free manner of beſtowing it accordingly. And this ſignifies Gods free undeſerved Favour in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to any works of our Righteouſneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it might be challenged as a Debt to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. Now to him that worketh is the reward not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned of grace but of debt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.6. if by Grace then it is no more of works, otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace; but if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace: otherwiſe Work is no more Work, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith; and that not of your ſelves: it is the Gift of God: Not of works leaſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an Holy Calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which he hath given us in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96243:183"/>Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began.</hi> Ver. 10. <hi>But is now made manifeſt by the appearing,</hi> &amp;c. Grace is mercy and love ſhewed freely out of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion, ſhewing mercy becauſe he will ſhew mercy, and loving us, becauſe he will love us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. and this is confirmed</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there was not, nor is any thing in us but what might move God to condemn us, for we have all ſinned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe God would take away boaſting, and have his Grace Glorified and Exalted in our Salvation; He will have all the Praiſe and Glory, though we have the Bleſſedneſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7, 9. that in the Ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his kindneſs toward us through Jeſus Chriſt; and ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27.</p>

               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> V. <hi>God Juſtifieth Sinners through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth for a Propitiation through Faith in his Blood.</hi> This is the effecting means, or material cauſe of our Juſtification, <hi>viz.</hi> Redemption and Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation through the Blood of Chriſt which is the Righteouſneſs of God treaſured up in him.</p>
            <p>By Redemption is meant properly ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance as is by paying of a Price; and ſo the Words Redeem and Redemption are frequently uſed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.13. <hi>Numb.</hi> 3.48, 49, 51. <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.24, 51, 52. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.7, 8 <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.8. from this proper Signification it is borrowed to ſignifie a deliverance without Price, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Chap</hi> 4.30. or rather by a Metonimy of the Cauſe, put for the higheſt effect, the ſtate of Glory; ſo that ſtate of Glory is called Redemption, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96243:184"/>being the compleating and crowning effect of Chriſts Redemption, therefore it's called the purchaſed Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>By a Propitiation is meant that which appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wrath of God for Sin, and wins his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and this Propitiation of Chriſt was two ways typified; Firſt, in the propitiatory Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whoſe Blood was ſhed, and the Mercy-ſeat, which was called the Propitiation, becauſe it covered the Ark wherein was the Law; and the Blood of the Sacrifices for Atonement was ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled by the High Prieſt before it; and this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy-ſeat was a ſign of God's Favourableneſs to a ſinful People in reſiding among them, and was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Now this Doctrine appears confirmed for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe Chriſt by the will of God gave himſelf a Ranſom for us, to redeem us from Sin and Puniſhment, Wrath and Curſe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. He gave himſelf for us to redeem us from all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; He gave himſelf to Death for us, was delivered for our Offences, his Death was the Price of our Redemption, that we might be juſtified in Gods Sight; God gave him up to Death, he ſpared him not, that he might be made Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>He gave his own life a Ranſome for many.</hi> And ſo 1 Tim. 2.6. <hi>He hereby bought us by this Price.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.6. <hi>He Redeemed us not with Silver and Gold, but with his precious Blood, as of a Lamb without ſpot.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18, 19. 2 Pet 2.1. Rev. 5.9. <hi>He ſuffering the Penalty due to us for Sin.</hi> 1 Pet. 2.24. <hi>He bare our Sins in his Body on the Tree.</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>He was
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96243:184"/>made a Curſe for us, thereby redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law; and that he might be made a Curſe he was made ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. Iſa. 53.5, 6. He ſubjected himſelf to the Law, both in active, as well as paſſive Obedience. Gal. 4 4. <hi>And obeyed his Father even to Death, doing and ſuffering at his Commandment,</hi> John 14.31. Heb. 10.7. <hi>And his Obedience was for our Juſtification.</hi> Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. So Chriſt ſatisfied both for our Debt of Righteouſneſs, and Debt of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for our Faultineſs, taint of Sin, and want of Righteouſneſs, as well as for our guilt and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxiouſneſs to puniſhment, that we might be free from Wrath and deemed Righteous in God's Sight; His Suffering was the conſummating Act of Redemption, and ſo all is attributed to it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9, 10. Even to his Blood, though other doings and ſufferings concur, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. We are righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by him, as we were guilty by <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 5.12.</p>
            <p n="2">2 God accepted this Price as a Satisfaction to his Juſtice, which he ſhewed in raiſing Chriſt from the Dead, and ſo acquitting him from all our Sins; He was juſtified by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. <hi>ult.</hi> raiſed for our Juſtification, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34. <hi>It is God that Juſtifieth: Who is he that condemneth?

            <p n="1">1. This Faith is believing on Chriſt, that we may be juſtified by him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Knowing that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96243:185"/>a Man is not juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt; even we have believed in Chriſt, that we might be juſtified by the Faith of Chriſt, and not by the works of the Law;</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt for Juſtification out of a ſence of our inability to obtain Juſtification by Works.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Faith doth not juſtify us, as an Act of Righteouſneſs, earning and procuring our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the work of it, for this would have been Juſtification by works, as under the Law, diametrically oppoſite to Grace, and free Gift, which excludes all conſideration of any works of ours, to be our Righteouſneſs under any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or diminutive terms whatever, whether you'l call it Legal or Evangelical, though you reckon it no more then the payment of a Pepper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. Faith in this caſe is counted a Not working, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. And it's not Faith that ſtands in ſtead of the Righteouſneſs of the Law, but the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which ſatisfieth for what we ought to have done or ſuffered, as hath been ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God Juſtifieth by Faith, as the Inſtrument whereby we receive Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, by which we are Juſtified properly; and we are juſtified by Faith only Metonymically, by reaſon of the Righteouſneſs received by it; and to be juſtified by Faith and Chriſt is all one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. By Faith we receive remiſſion of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10 43. Its effect is the reception of Juſtification, not the working of it; as a man may be ſaid to be maintained by his hands, or nouriſhed by his mouth, when thoſe do but receive that which nouriſheth; his food and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:96243:186"/>drink; the Cup is put for the Liquor in the Cup, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26, 27. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. and 13.22. Chriſt is in us by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. perceived, eat, drunk, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.49, 53.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Faith is to be underſtood Excluſively, to all our works for Juſtification; we defend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts Juſtification by faith only; and there is nothing more ſully expreſſed in Scripture Phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We muſt underſtand faith in a full ſence of receiving Remiſſion of the ſault, as well as of the puniſhment; we believe that God accounts not the fault to us of the leaſt ſin; and where faith is ſaid to be accounted for Righteouſneſs, it is becauſe of the object it receives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 21. We believe Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to us, as our ſins to him; or elſe we receive not remiſſion of Sins by believing, which is contrary to charging us with ſin and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; which charging ſignifieth imputing ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34 together with the removal of the charge of ſin we receive the Gift of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. and this we have in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Chriſt's Redemption and Blood-ſhed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28.</p>

               <hi>Obſ.</hi> VIII. <hi>That God aimed, in ſetting forth Chriſt as a Propitiation through Faith in his blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs now under the Goſpel, in the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins that are paſt, as well as preſent.</hi> Of thoſe ſins that were paſt and committed under the Old Teſtament, which was Gods time of forbearing, in pardoning long before his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96243:186"/>Juſtice was actually ſatisfied by Chriſts atonement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.26. The ground of thoſe pardons is now revealed by Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.5, 6. and 56.1. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10. that this pardon may be no blemiſh to the Juſtice of God now ſatisfied, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10.</p>
            <p>By his Righteouſneſs is meant that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God mentioned in the Propoſition; and <hi>Ver.</hi> 21, 22. of which the Text is but a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>viz.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of God, not his Eſſential Righteouſneſs; that which is an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential property of God, but a Righteouſneſs which is upon all them that believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3, 4. Chriſts Righteouſneſs which is the end of the Law, and therefore called God's Righteouſneſs, that which Chriſt wrought for us, which is given to us and we receive by Faith; that whereby Chriſt anſwered the Law for us, by which as the price he redeemed us; which is called God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: becauſe it is of God's working, and it only hath God's Acceptance and Approbation. As Chriſt is called the Lamb of God, becauſe God provided him and accepts him as an Offering, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. Upon the like account Chriſt's Kingdom is called the Kingdom of God: becauſe God's own hand ſets it up, and maintains it, and rules it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. Chriſt that became obedient to Death, to work this Righteouſneſs, was God as well as Man; <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 8. and this is that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which the Apoſtle oppoſeth to his own, that which is in Chriſt which he had through Faith; and this is the Righteouſneſs of God here, and in other places, the righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:96243:187"/>
            <p n="2">2. God aimed at declaring in Goſpel-times his Righteouſneſs in forgiving of Sins paſt, in the time of God's forbearance under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and alſo in juſtifying thoſe that believe in Chriſt at preſent: For it was by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſame Chriſt that Sins were pardoned under the Old Teſtament, as well as now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. Chriſt was the Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. only the Righteouſneſs was not actually fulfilled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed then, but it was ſhaddowed out then by the Sacrifices, Ranſoms, Redemptions, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 9, 10. So this was a time of God's forbearance, becauſe he pardoned ſins, as it were without preſent payment and ſatisfaction. He had patience and did not exact the Debt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Chriſt paid all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.26. but then God promiſed that he would reveal his Righteouſneſs in due time, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 51.5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98.2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. and this he hath done by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> IX. <hi>The end of this Manifeſtation is, that God may appear juſt in forgiving Sins paſt as well as preſent, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> Here the Eſſential property of God is exalted and appears glorious in juſtifying by the fore-mentioned Righteouſneſs of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As God Juſtifieth freely by Grace, he would appear hereby Juſt in Juſtifying Sinners; for it would be a blemiſh to Gods Juſtice to forgive without a Satisfaction, and Righteouſneſs perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and therefore though he be Gracious and Merciful, yet he will not clear the Guilty, <hi>Exod.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. God would have it appear that he only is Juſt, and therefore ſaveth us not by our own Righteouſneſs, but by his, which is indeed the more exalted by our Unrighteouſneſs occaſionally, though God is not therefore unrighteous in taking vengeance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God would appear to be the only procurer and worker of our Righteouſneſs, and ſo our Juſtifier by way of procurement, as well as by way of judgment, and ſo he will juſtifie us by a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of his own, and not by our own, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.17. <hi>Ch.</hi> 45.22, 24, 25. that we may Glory in the Lord only, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30, 31.</p>

            <p n="2">2.

The wrath of God is an unſupportable burden, and the foundation of all miſeries, which foundation is razed, and a foundation of bleſſedneſs laid, whereby we have peace with God, and are fully reconciled to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Ye who were ſometimes alienated, and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his fleſh through death, to preſent you holy and unblameable, and unreprovable in his fight.</hi> Now

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="4">4. Hence they are delivered from a condemning Conſcience, which otherwiſe would ſtill gnaw them as a Worm. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. If the Blood of Bulls and Goats, ſanctified to the purifying of the fleſh, <hi>how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal ſpirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works?</hi> &amp;c. A guilty conſcience is a foul conſcience, and it will make all his ſervices and duties dead works, unfit for the ſervice of the living God; its the blood of Chriſt applied by Faith, that takes off this foulneſs of guilt from the conſcience, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the blood of Chriſt hath the only efficacy this way, to take off the conſcience of Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence they come to have a good conſcience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is an everlaſting Righteouſneſs by which their ſtanding in Chriſt is ſecured, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. Its an eternal Redemption that is obtained. So <hi>Dan</hi> 9.24. Whereas by the Law thoſe that were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96243:189"/>juſtified to day typically, might fall under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation ſo far as to need another ſacrifice for Sin, they had no real purgation of conſcience from ſin by thoſe Sacrifices, and therefore could not have a laſting delivery of their conſciences from guilt by them; here it is far otherwiſe, here is an effectual, compleat and perpetual Redemption, reaching the conſcience of the Sinner, and for the purging away all ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It's a Righteouſneſs of infinite value, becauſe it is the Righteouſneſs of one that is God, and his Name is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> our Righteouſneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. It is therefore more powerful to ſave than <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was to deſtroy or condemn, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Chriſt is here the power of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. thence we are powerful, and conquer by Faith: likewiſe there's a marvelous plenty of Mercy and Grace, that is brought to us by <hi>Jehovah</hi> our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, plenteous Redemption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.7. it muſt be moſt plentiful becauſe infinite; though no creature could ſatisfie for ſin, yet <hi>Jehovah</hi> could do it abundantly, and therefore in Chriſt Gods merey prevails high above our ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="7">7.

To the wicked, its dehortation unto them from continuance in ſin, under Gods wrath, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headlong to Damnation, for here is a door of Mercy opened to them, a Righteouſneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, that they may be freely accepted of God; ſome men are Deſperadoes; over Shooes over Boots, they are reſolved to run the riſque of it, and pleaſe themſelves, they ſhall ſpeed as well as others: And ſome men would be juſtified, but ſeek for it in ſome wrong way; ſome will go to the Pope to quiet their Conſciences by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, ſome to their own works and performances, but you are Exhorted to look out for the true Righteouſneſs. Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpel, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me, behold me, the Kingdom of Heaven is open, mercy and righteouſneſs are freely offered, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 7. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12.

            <p n="1">1. If you do, you remain under the wrath of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. under the curſe of the Law, which like a Flood ſweeps away all that are found out of this Ark, the Lord Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11.5, 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your condemnation will be aggravated by refuſing ſo great Salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. you will have no cloak for your ſins when you refuſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.22. you cannot ſay you are undone
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96243:192"/>by your paſt ſins beyond recovery, and therefore it is in vain to ſtrive, for behold Remiſſion of ſins is proclaimed unto you, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.10, 11. and what an horrid ſin is it to deſpiſe the blood of the Son of God? <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.11.</p>
            <p>Obj. I. <hi>If God juſtifie the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly, what need I forſake <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs at all?</hi> Rom. 6.1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Thou canſt not ſeek Juſtification truly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou haſt a mind to live to God in friendſhip with him, for Juſtification is Gods way of taking us into friendſhip with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2. and of reconciling us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. The uſe that thou art to make of it, it is to ſeek Gods friendſhip by it, and the enjoyment of him; why doth a Man ſeek a pardon if he intend to go on in Rebellion, and ſtand out in deſiance to his Prince? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. They ſeek pardon in a mocking way that intend not to return to obedience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8.</p>
            <p>Obj. II. <hi>My ſins are ſo great that I have no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Chriſts Righteouſneſs is for all ſorts of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that believe, whether <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and now great ſinners were of both ſorts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. and even for thoſe that killed and murdered the Lord of glory, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. for the chief of ſinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Act.</hi> 16. Where ſin abounds grace ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abounds, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. your ſins are but the ſins of a Creature, but his righteouſneſs is the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.11, 13.</p>
            <p>Exhort. II. <hi>It Exhorts thoſe that have a mind to turn to God, to turn the right way by faith in Chriſt for Juſtification.</hi> Let them not ſeek by Works as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96243:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>moſt in the World do, and all are prone to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32. but this Doctrine ſeems very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, yea, pernicious to a Natural man. <hi>Become a fool that thou may'ſt be wiſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you will labour in the ſire, and weary your ſelves for very vanity, and be under continual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts and diſcouragements, for you can do no good work while you are in the fleſh under the Law, and its Curſe, before God have received you into favour, for Juſtification is in order of Nature before true Holineſs of Heart and Life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. Faith is the great Work and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while you believe not, you diſhonour Chriſt and his Death, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. <hi>ch.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore come boldly though a great ſinner, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.43. and ſeek Righteouſneſs in Chriſt with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But how ſhall I get Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Faith is the gift of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. and by the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10, 17. Faith comes by hearing the Goſpel preached, and that comes in working of faith, not in word only, but in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5. beyond what can be done by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or humane attainment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. therefore If thou haſt no beginning in thee of it, thy only way is to attend to the Goſpel, and to meditate on thy ſin and miſery, and Chriſts excellency, that ſo thou may'ſt be inclined in thy heart to believe, <hi>Song.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 9.10 for this is the way God uſeth to beget faith, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. But if thou haſt a deſire and inclination to fly from thy ſelf to Chriſt in the bent of thy heart, ſo that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96243:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>thou preferreſt Chriſt above all, then the ſpirit hath begun, and will carry on the work, ſo that now thou mayſt pray confidently for faith, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.24.</p>
            <p>Obj. III. <hi>But without holineſs no Man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. <hi>And how ſhall I do to get holineſs? And I cannot ſanctifie my ſelf; and this confidence you ſpeak of may ſlacken my diligence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> If thou haſt Righteouſneſs in Chriſt, God will make thee holy; and this confidence is the only way to get Holineſs becauſe of that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. The new Covenant is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him which promiſeth a new Heart; if ſin be forgiven, thou ſhalt be delivered from the power, and quickned by the ſame Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt whereby thou art Juſtified, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12, 13.</p>
            <p>Exhort. III. <hi>It Exhorteth them that are juſtified by Faith:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To walk humbly, as nothing of themſelves, to acknowledge themſelves Enemies to God by Nature, and acknowledge ſins in the greatneſs and heinouſneſs of them, that they are ſaved freely by a Righteouſneſs of another, not by their own, yea, ſo far fallen, that the Juſtice of God would have been againſt them if it had not been ſatisfied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. but now ſee that Chriſt hath ſatisfied, and his Righteouſneſs is above their Sins, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.31.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To praiſe and glorifie God through Chriſt for this Grace. Oh! what abundant grace and love appears in Gods waſhing and cleanſing us by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96243:193"/>his Sons blood, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Son Sin and Curſe for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5, 8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9, 10. <hi>Ch.</hi> 3.16, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. and what a glorious excellent Righteouſneſs hath God given us in Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To walk comfortably upon the account of this Righteouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1, 2. Triumph over Sin and Affliction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.39. Be confident in expecting great things from God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. for though you be unworthy, and grace will ſhew you your own unworthineſs, yet you ſtand upon the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, glory in the hope of Gods glory, for if Chriſt died to reconcile you when you were Enemies, much more will he ſave you by his life now you are reconciled, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. 10. Ask boldly for what you want, for God is in Chriſts Manhood as the Mercy-ſeat; when ever Sin ſtings you, and objections trouble you, look to the Brazen Serpent, confeſs Sin and truſt for Pardon, meditate on Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and the abundance of grace in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. If you find never ſo much Ungodlineſs, no good qualifications, yet Chriſt is at hand for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16, 17. In all your Sins apply your ſelves to this Fountain. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. If Sin lye on conſcience, it weakens peace and ſpiritual ſtrength; lye not under guilt with a ſlaviſh fear, you have a Righteouſneſs to deliver you from it, applying it by Faith, that you may have no more conſcience of Sin as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. you have a better Righteouſneſs than any Perfectioniſts can have.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96243:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Exhort. IV. <hi>Hold faſt this way of Juſtification, notwithſtanding all the noiſe that is made in the World againſt it, for the Devil will ſtrive to ſcare you out of it, or ſteal it from you, as he did from the</hi> Jews, <hi>from the</hi> Galatians, <hi>the</hi> Papiſts, <hi>and many</hi> Proteſtants. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. And the Apoſtle reckons it's by a Spiritual bewitchery he will ſtrive to get you to truſt on Works, and tell you it is for the promoting of Holineſs, and to truſt on Works to get Chriſt, and to lay Works loweſt in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: If you loſe this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt under any colour or pretence whatever you loſe all. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3. Do not ſo diſhonour Chriſt as to think of procuring that by Works which you have fully in Chriſt; think not that the Goſpel requires another Juſtification to gain this, for the Goſpel is no legal Covenant, but a Declaration of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, and we being Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified are Heirs by Adoption and Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.25. This is the Doctrine which glorifieth God and abaſeth the Creature, which is a great mark of its truth: Beware therefore of carnal reaſon, which will go quite contrary, and make Chriſts righteouſneſs a ſtumbling Stone to thee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.32, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>3.</p>
            <p>V. <hi>Walk as one that enjoys the favour of God in Chriſt:</hi> Let him have the honour of it, walk therefore in Holineſs, knowing by what price you are redeemed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. laſt. Love God that hath loved you firſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.16. Believe that God will inable to Holineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. Particularly, walk in Love to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:96243:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>Saints, exerciſe forgiveneſs to your Enemies; ſenſe of your own Sins, and Gods forgiving you, will cauſe you to pity and forgive others, elſe you cannot pray or truſt for forgiveneſs of your own Sins upon reaſonable grounds, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31, 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.14, 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.21. Deſire grace may be exalted upon others, and wait patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the full Declaration of Juſtification at the great day, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19. for here your Juſtification is known only by Faith, but in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things you are dealt with as a Sinner; then your Righteouſneſs ſhall appear openly, and you ſhall be dealt with according to it.</p>
